        "value": "Scarcity and urgency are two of the strongest mental triggers in marketing because they create a sense of exclusivity and importance around a product or service. By creating a sense of limited availability or a deadline for a promotion, businesses can motivate customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late.\n\nOver the last eight years, many businesses have leveraged these triggers in their marketing campaigns to great success. Scarcity and urgency have been used to sell everything from digital products to physical goods and services, and have proven to be highly effective in driving conversions and increasing revenue.\n\nThis is because scarcity and urgency tap into the natural human desire for instant gratification and fear of missing out (FOMO). When customers believe that they may miss out on a valuable opportunity if they don't act quickly, they are more likely to take action and make a purchase.\n\nFurthermore, scarcity and urgency can be combined with other mental triggers, such as social proof and authority, to create even more powerful marketing campaigns. By demonstrating the popularity and effectiveness of a product or service, businesses can increase the perceived value and urgency of a promotion, leading to even more sales and revenue.\n\nOverall, scarcity and urgency are powerful mental triggers that have been proven to drive results in marketing campaigns. By leveraging these triggers, businesses can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity around their products or services, motivating customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late."

This includes the need for adventure, stimulation, and new experiences.\n3. Significance: The need to feel important, special, and unique. This includes the need for recognition, achievement, and respect.\n4. Connection: The need for social connection and love. This includes the need for intimacy, belonging, and friendship.\n5. Growth: The need for personal growth and development. This includes the need for learning, self-improvement, and progress.\n6. Contribution: The need to make a positive impact in the world. This includes the need to give back, help others, and make a difference.\n\nAccording to Tony Robbins, these six needs are universal and apply to all individuals. Each person may prioritize these needs differently, and may fulfill them in different ways, but they are fundamental drivers of human behavior. By understanding these needs, individuals can gain insight into their own motivations and behaviors, and can use this knowledge to create a more fulfilling and meaningful life."

We then pass these values to the `replacePlaceholders()` method, which iterates over the entries in the `replacements` map and replaces each placeholder in the input string with its corresponding value using the `replace()` method. Finally, the `replacePlaceholders()` method returns the modified string, which is printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```csharp\nThis is a new student at point 3, 4\n```\nNote that you can modify the `replacements` map to include additional placeholders and their corresponding values, and the `replacePlaceholders()` method will automatically replace them in the input string."

PEEK can be used in this process by dissolving it in a suitable solvent and then heating it to induce phase separation.\n4. Polymer blending: This process involves blending PEEK with other polymers to create a membrane with specific properties. For example, blending PEEK with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) can create a membrane with enhanced mechanical strength and chemical resistance.\n\nOverall, PEEK can be used in a variety of membrane manufacturing processes to create membranes with specific properties, including porosity, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance. The specific manufacturing process used will depend on the desired properties of the membrane and the intended application."

        "value": "Certainly! Here's a technical overview of a referral system similar to Dropbox's, but instead of free space, users will earn \"credits\" for every three friends they recommend.\n\n1. Database schema:\nTo implement this referral system, you'll need a database schema to store user information and their referral relationships. The schema should include the following tables:\n* Users: This table will store basic user information like user\\_id, email, username, and total\\_credits.\n* Referrals: This table will store referral relationships, including referrer\\_id (the user who sent the referral), referee\\_id (the invited user), and referral\\_status (whether the referral is pending, accepted, or rejected).\n1. Unique referral links:\nTo track referrals, generate unique referral links for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, associate their account with the referrer's user\\_id. This can be achieved by appending a referral code (such as a unique hash) to the signup URL, which can be mapped back to the referrer's user\\_id.\n2. Referral tracking and credit calculation:\nTrack the number of successful referrals for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, update the Referrals table with the new relationship and set the referral\\_status to 'pending'. Once the new user completes the necessary steps to qualify as a successful referral (e.g., email verification, account activation), update the referral\\_status to 'accepted'.\n\nPeriodically (or using a trigger), calculate the number of successful referrals for each user. For every three successful referrals, award the referrer with additional credits. Update the Users table to reflect the new credit balance.\n\n1. API endpoints:\nDevelop the following API endpoints to support the referral system:\n* GET /referral-link: Generate and return a unique referral link for the logged-in user.\n* POST /signup: Create a new user account and process the referral, if any. This should include validating the referral code, associating the new user with the referrer, and updating the Referrals table.\n* GET /referral-status: Retrieve the referral status and credit balance for the logged-in user.\n1. Frontend integration:\nIntegrate the referral system into your application's frontend by adding the following components:\n* Referral link sharing: Allow users to share their unique referral link via email, social media, or other messaging platforms.\n* Referral status dashboard: Display the user's referral status, including the number of successful referrals and their credit balance.\n* In-app notifications: Notify users when they've earned additional credits from successful referrals.\n1. Analytics and monitoring:\nMonitor the performance of the referral system, tracking metrics such as the number of successful referrals, credits awarded, and the conversion rate of referred users. Use this data to optimize the referral process and identify potential issues.\n\nIn summary, the proposed referral system will involve creating a database schema to store user and referral information, generating unique referral links, tracking referrals and awarding credits, and integrating these features into your application's frontend."

This encourages users to share your product with their networks, driving new customers and increasing brand exposure.\n2. Loyalty programs:\nLoyalty programs reward users for their continued engagement and usage of your product or service. Users can earn points, discounts, or other benefits based on their activity, purchases, or milestones. By incentivizing users to stay active and engaged, loyalty programs can increase retention and drive long-term growth.\n3. Gamification:\nGamification involves incorporating game-like elements and mechanics into your product or service to engage and motivate users. Examples include leaderboards, badges, challenges, and rewards. Gamification can encourage users to explore your product more thoroughly, complete specific actions, and invite others to join.\n4. Content marketing:\nCreating high-quality, relevant, and shareable content can help attract and engage users. Content marketing can include blog posts, infographics, videos, podcasts, and social media updates. By providing valuable content, you can drive organic growth through search engine optimization (SEO) and social sharing.\n5. Influencer marketing:\nPartnering with influencers in your niche can help increase brand exposure and reach new audiences. Influencers can share your product or service with their followers, who are more likely to trust their recommendations. This can drive growth by attracting new users who might not have discovered your product otherwise.\n6. Social media contests and giveaways:\nHosting contests or giveaways on social media can encourage users to engage with your brand and share your content with their friends. This strategy can help increase brand visibility, drive traffic to your website, and attract new users.\n7. Email marketing:\nBuilding an email list and sending targeted, personalized content can be an effective way to engage users and encourage them to share your product with their networks. By nurturing relationships with your existing users, you can increase retention and drive growth through word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nEach growth strategy has its unique benefits and challenges, so it's essential to test and optimize different approaches to find what works best for your product or service."

It has several messages defined, including input and output messages for various operations like Init, GetAllSeats, GetSeatStatus, Lock, Unlock, and Reserve.\n\nTo make the Init function available as a service URL using JAX-WS, SOAP, and Wildfly, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new Java project and add the necessary dependencies for JAX-WS and Wildfly.\n2. Create a Java class that implements the Init operation defined in the WSDL file. This class should be annotated with @WebService and @SOAPBinding annotations. The @WebService annotation should have the endpointInterface attribute set to the fully qualified name of the Init interface.\n3. Use the wsgen tool to generate the required artifacts for JAX-WS, including the Java class and the WSDL file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:\n```bash\nwsgen -keep -cp <classpath> com.example.InitService\n```\nwhere <classpath> is the classpath of your project and com.example.InitService is the fully qualified name of the Java class created in step 2.\n4. Deploy the generated artifacts to Wildfly by copying them to the WEB-INF/classes directory of your web application.\n\n1. Finally, you can access the Init function as a service URL by sending a SOAP request to the endpoint URL of the web service, which should be in the format:\n```php\nhttp://<hostname>:<port>/<web-context-root>/<service-name>\n```\nwhere <hostname> is the hostname of the server running Wildfly, <port> is the port number for the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, <web-context-root> is the context root of the web application, and <service-name> is the name of the web service as defined in the WSDL file.\n\nHere is an example Java code for implementing the Init operation:\n```less\n@WebService(endpointInterface = \"com.example.Init\")\n@SOAPBinding(style = Style.RPC)\npublic class InitServiceImpl implements Init {\n \n    @Override\n    public InitResponse init(Init parameters) throws CinemaException {\n        // Your implementation code for the Init operation goes here\n        return new InitResponse();\n    }\n \n}\n```\nAssuming the generated artifacts are deployed to a web application with the context root \"cinema\", and the service name is \"CinemaService\", you can access the Init operation using the following service URL:\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8080/cinema/CinemaService\n```"

Alternatively, you can create a form in an HTML file and submit it using the POST method to the same URL.\n\nFor example, you can create a simple HTML form as follows:\n```php\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"http://localhost:8080/cinema/CinemaService/init\" method=\"post\">\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Initialize Cinema\">\n    </form>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nWhen you open this HTML file in your browser and click on the \"Initialize Cinema\" button, it will submit a POST request to the `init` method and initialize the cinema."

Then, we loop through the seats in the original `ArrayList` and add them to the `Map`.\n\nNext, we get the `SeatExtended` object that corresponds to the given `seat` parameter by concatenating its row and column and using that as the key to look it up in the `Map`.\n\nIf the seat is found, we lock it by setting its `availability` to `SeatStatus.LOCKED`. Then, we loop through the remaining seats and lock them as well, by incrementing the column of the current seat and looking up the next seat in the `Map` using the new key. If the next seat is found, we lock it as well.\n\nThis implementation has an overall time complexity of O(n) due to the initial loop that adds the seats to the `Map`, but it has a better lookup time complexity than the original implementation when searching for seats."

When the user interacts with the canvas, you can convert their input into 3D geometry and update the canvas accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ThreeJS scene with a camera and lighting:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber'\n\nconst ThreeCanvas = () => {\n  const camera = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <Canvas>\n      <perspectiveCamera ref={camera} position={[0, 0, 5]} />\n      <ambientLight />\n      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />\n    </Canvas>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ThreeCanvas\n```\nThe next step is to create a new component that will render the 2D drawing tool. In this component, you will need to import the necessary ReactJS modules. You will also need to set up event listeners to capture user input, such as mouse clicks or mouse movements. When the user interacts with the drawing tool, you can update the canvas with their input, such as drawing lines or shapes. You can also display the vertices of the shape/s in a sidebar component.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ReactJS component that captures user input:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst DrawingTool = () => {\n  const [vertices, setVertices] = useState([])\n\n  const onPointerDown = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  const onPointerMove = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <svg\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"100%\"\n        onPointerDown={onPointerDown}\n        onPointerMove={onPointerMove}\n      >\n        {/* Render drawing tool here */}\n      </svg>\n      <ul>\n        {vertices.map((vertex, index) => (\n          <li key={index}>\n            {vertex.x}, {vertex.y}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default DrawingTool\n```\nFinally, you will need to style your components using CSS. You can use CSS to customize the look and feel of your drawing tool and canvas, as well as the layout of your sidebar component.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of how to create a simple drawing app using ReactJS and ThreeJS with the Drei library. I hope this helps!"

We're also using another `useState` hook to keep track of whether or not the user is currently drawing.\n\nIn the `onPointerDown` function, we set the `isDrawing` state to `true` and add the first vertex to the `vertices` array. In the `onPointerMove` function, we add each subsequent vertex to the `vertices` array as long as the user is currently drawing. Finally, in the `onPointerUp` function, we set the `isDrawing` state to `false`.\n\nWe're rendering the drawing as a `polyline` element within the SVG. We use the `map` method to convert the array of vertices into a string of points in the format `x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 ...`. We're also displaying the vertices in a sidebar as an unordered list.\n\nThis code will allow the user to draw connected lines with the drawing tool. You can modify it to support drawing other shapes, like rectangles, squares, triangles, and curves, by adding more event handlers and geometry generation functions."

The primary goal of user research is to gain insights into the users' experiences, pain points, and requirements to inform the design and development of products or services that meet their needs. Methods commonly used in user research include interviews, surveys, usability testing, observation, and user personas.\n\nDesign Research:\nDesign research, also known as design thinking or design strategy, is a broader approach that encompasses user research but also includes other aspects of the design and development process. Design research aims to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement in the overall user experience by examining the relationships between users, products, and the context in which they interact. It involves understanding not just the users but also the market, competition, and technological landscape.\n\nWhile user research primarily focuses on understanding the end-users, design research takes a more holistic approach by considering the entire ecosystem in which the product or service will exist. This may involve studying business models, organizational structures, and technological trends, in addition to user needs and preferences.\n\nIn summary, user research is a subset of design research, with a more specific focus on understanding the target users. Design research encompasses user research but also considers other factors, such as market trends and the broader context, to inform the design and development of products or services that are both user-centric and aligned with business objectives."

Using algebraic topology, we can analyze the structure of this space and determine the locations of the mines based on certain topological invariants.\n\nFor instance, one way to do this is to compute the homotopy groups of the space. Homotopy groups are a way of describing the holes in a space, and they can be used to infer information about the locations of the mines on the Minesweeper board. In the case of the board above, we can compute the first homotopy group of the space, which describes the number and \"shape\" of the holes in the space. In this case, the first homotopy group would tell us that there are four holes in the space, arranged in a square shape.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the mines in the game are located in the four corners of the board, as shown below:\n```\n 1  1  1  1  1\n 1  M  ?  ?  1\n 1  ?  ?  ?  1\n 1  ?  ?  M  1\n 1  1  1  1  1\n```\nOf course, this is just one example of how algebraic topology could be used to solve Minesweeper. There are many other possible approaches, and the specific details of how to implement them would depend on the specific game board and the topological invariants being used. As I mentioned before, implementing a solution like this would require a deep understanding of both algebraic topology and the game of Minesweeper."

There are many possible topological invariants that could be used for this, such as homotopy groups, Betti numbers, or persistent homology.\n3.

Use your understanding of the citadel empire to write a response to the following post: Hey Apes, Crux here.\n\nYou may remember my posts over the last year+ about the Citadel Empire, trying to untangle the spider web of companies Ken Griffin has created. I made ownership diagrams and did deep dives, trying to understand the why and how Citadel is structured.\n\nThere are endless rabbit holes and I had to put some boundaries on the project, so I simply started compiling a list of everything I have found.\n\nThat’s all this post is: the list. Skip ahead if you want to see it.\n\nThere is no way this is all-inclusive.\n\nAlso, one of my first posts claimed Ken Griffin was a butterfly lover because I found a “Red Admiral” trust of his, which is a type of butterfly.\n\nSpoiler alert: Ken Griffin likes butterflies even more than I thought.\nr/Superstonk - The Citadel Empire, revealed: 500+ entities linked to Ken Griffin, all from public records. I have built the edge of the puzzle, can you help me fill in the middle? PS - Ken Griffin is still a butterfly lover\nBackground, and what this list is and isn’t\n\nI reviewed thousands of public records from government regulators, corporate directories, county recorders, and property ownership databases to identify any evidence of business or assets (e.g. real estate) linked to Ken Griffin.\n\nThis list is basic. Each row contains four columns:\n\n An index number for reference;\n\n An entity’s name;\n\n A source document/link and purpose for the entity, if I could determine it; and\n\n My hypothesis for what an entity’s name means, as many are just combinations of letters.\n\nI have many more details, but didn’t think it made sense to post all that right now. Ask if you want to see more on a particular entity, and please correct me if you see mistakes.\n\nI made sure to find evidence directly linking any of these entities to Griffin. Just because a business has “Citadel” in the name doesn’t mean it is necessarily related to Ken Griffin’s Citadel.\n\nOf particular help were SEC filings and FINRA BrokerCheck and Form ADV reports - these self-disclosed affiliated companies and described the ownership structures. If you don’t see a source for an entity in this list named “CITADEL …” it is one of these, at one point I was just getting down as many names as I could.\n\nAnother source, the National Futures Association, has long lists of self-disclosed active and ceased “pools” (i.e. funds) run by Citadel Advisors (the hedge fund): https://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/basic-profile.aspx?nfaid=iRgkpH8tdFs%3D\n\nI used other links to identify these entities. Business addresses, signatures on documents from key lieutenants like Gerald Beeson and Steve Atkinson, and other “enablers” on documents like lawyers who exercised power of attorney for real estate transactions.\n\nBut this list won’t include everything I’ve found:\n\n I’m not going to dive into details of Ken’s family - where his kids, nieces and nephews, siblings, etc. reside, what schools they go to, their social media accounts, etc.\n\n I’m not going to show you where his sister and brother-in-law’s yacht is docked.\n\n I’m not going to give you the VINs of the two (!) McLaren Senna GTR’s he had shipped to the US.\n\n I’m not going to give you the names of his nannies, property managers, family IT staff, etc.\n\nYou may find these things interesting, and they are leads I have followed, but they’re not in the public interest. The focus here is Citadel, its eye-popping corporate structure, and the personal assets Ken Griffin is accumulating. A number of these assets have not been reported in the media. I believe there are many more entities than what I've compiled, especially overseas. My focus has mostly been US-based, as those are records I am familiar with.\nI can use your help:\n\n The entities highlighted yellow - I can link them to Ken Griffin, but I don’t know their purpose. Do you know?\n\n I have found many companies scattered around the globe, and there must be more. What are they?\n\n Ken Griffin has spent an incredible amount of money on art. What entities hold it?\n\n Ken Griffin has donated hundreds of millions to universities, museums etc. I have only researched in detail his contributions to Harvard, which revealed a Cayman Island company through which the donation was made. What entities were used to make donations elsewhere?\n\n Ken Griffin is one of the biggest donors to US politics in recent years, as reported in the media. Are there other “dark money” contributions he has made, and how did he make them?\n\n A lot has been made by the media about how Ken Griffin spends his money, but who is giving Ken Griffin their money? Who are the pension funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, etc. that gave Citadel their money, and how much and when? Are there feeder funds that invest with Citadel and who operates them?"

But given Citadel's reputation for being a hedge fund and investment firm, I'm thinking it might have something to do with their business operations.\n\nAlive: Yeah, you're probably right. Maybe they're looking to set up a private retreat for their top clients or something like that.\n\nCruxHub: That's another possibility. Or maybe they're looking to use it as a location for some sort of off-site meetings or conferences.\n\nAlive: Yeah, that makes sense.

        "value": "Alice: Hi /u/CruxHub, I've received the data batch you sent over. From what I can see, it looks like a list of entities that are connected to Citadel LLC, a large investment firm. It seems like many of these entities have been dissolved or have ceased trading.\n\n/u/CruxHub: That's correct, Alice. We're trying to gain a better understanding of Citadel's corporate structure and how they operate. Can you take a deeper dive into the data and see if you can find any non-standard insights?\n\nAlice: Sure thing. One thing I've noticed is that a lot of these entities have similar names, such as \"Citadel Clearing LLC\" and \"Citadel Miami HQ\". This suggests that they may be connected in some way. Additionally, some of the entities have hypothesized acronyms listed next to them, like \"CE TM\" for \"Citadel Enterprise Trademark Holdings\". This could be a clue that these entities have specific purposes within the larger organization.\n\n/u/CruxHub: Interesting, what else have you found?\n\nAlice: Well, I've also noticed that some of the entities are based in foreign countries, like \"CITADEL SECURITIES CANADA ULC\" and \"CIG(E) LLP\" which is based in Europe. This could indicate that Citadel has a global reach and operations in multiple countries.

It seems like many of these entities have been dissolved or have ceased trading.\n\n/u/CruxHub: That's correct, Alice. We're trying to gain a better understanding of Citadel's corporate structure and how they operate. Can you take a deeper dive into the data and see if you can find any non-standard insights?\n\nAlice: Sure thing. One thing I've noticed is that a lot of these entities have similar names, such as \"Citadel Clearing LLC\" and \"Citadel Miami HQ\". This suggests that they may be connected in some way. Additionally, some of the entities have hypothesized acronyms listed next to them, like \"CE TM\" for \"Citadel Enterprise Trademark Holdings\". This could be a clue that these entities have specific purposes within the larger organization.\n\n/u/CruxHub: Interesting, what else have you found?\n\nAlice: Well, I've also noticed that some of the entities are based in foreign countries, like \"CITADEL SECURITIES CANADA ULC\" and \"CIG(E) LLP\" which is based in Europe.

It is characterized by a lack of reliance on coursebooks, a focus on conversational activities, and an emphasis on the spontaneous language produced by the learners. The aim of Dogme is to create an engaging and meaningful learning experience for the students by tapping into their personal experiences and motivations.\n\nThe lexical approach, on the other hand, is a teaching methodology that focuses on vocabulary acquisition as the primary means of acquiring a foreign language. The lexical approach emphasizes the importance of acquiring a large vocabulary in the target language in order to be able to communicate effectively. It argues that grammar rules and structures follow naturally from exposure to words in context. The lexical approach is based on the idea that meaning is central to language, and that vocabulary should therefore be taught in meaningful chunks or \"lexical phrases.\"\n\nIn summary, the Dogme approach emphasizes the learner's spontaneous language and personal experiences, while the lexical approach emphasizes vocabulary acquisition as the key to language learning."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Implementing a netfilter in Linux using Rust requires a deep understanding of both the Linux kernel and Rust programming language. Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Install Rust: To get started, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.\n2. Set up your development environment: You will need to install the Linux kernel headers on your development machine. You can install the headers for your current kernel using the following command:\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n```\n1. Create a new Rust project: Once you have Rust and the kernel headers installed, you can create a new Rust project using the `cargo new` command. For example:\n```sh\ncargo new my_netfilter --bin\n```\n1. Write your code: You will need to write the actual code that implements your netfilter. Rust provides a set of FFI bindings to the Linux kernel, which you can use to interface with the kernel. You will need to use these bindings to register your netfilter hook function with the kernel's netfilter framework. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to register a netfilter hook function using Rust:\n```rust\nuse libc::{c_int, c_uint};\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\nuse std::ptr;\n\n// Define the netfilter hook function\nextern \"C\" fn my_netfilter_hook(\n    skb: *mut c_void,\n    nf_hook_state: *mut nf_hook_state_t\n) -> c_uint {\n    // Your netfilter hook code goes here\n    // ...\n\n    // Accept the packet\n    NF_ACCEPT\n}\n\n// Register the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn init_module() -> c_int {\n    let hook_ops = nf_hook_ops {\n        hook: Some(my_netfilter_hook),\n        hooknum: NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING as u_int8_t,\n        pf: PF_INET as u_int16_t,\n        priority: NF_IP_PRI_FIRST,\n    };\n    let result = unsafe {\n        nf_register_hook(&hook_ops)\n    };\n    if result < 0 {\n        return result as c_int;\n    }\n    0\n}\n\n// Unregister the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn cleanup_module() -> c_void {\n    unsafe {\n        nf_unregister_hook(&hook_ops);\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Build your kernel module: Once you have written your code, you can use the `cargo build` command to build your kernel module. This will produce a `.ko` file that you can load into the kernel using the `insmod` command.\n2. Load your kernel module: To load your kernel module, use the `insmod` command. For example:\n```sh\nsudo insmod my_netfilter.ko\n```\n1. Test your netfilter: Once your module is loaded, you can test your netfilter by sending packets through the network interface that your netfilter is hooked to. You can use tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor the packets and verify that your netfilter is working correctly.\n\nNote: Writing kernel modules can be dangerous and may potentially harm your system. Be careful while writing and testing your code."

The secondary thrusters were located on the nose and tail of the orbiter and were used for fine-tuning the spacecraft's attitude, or orientation in space.\n\nEach set of thrusters had multiple redundant thrusters, so that if one failed, the others could still function. Additionally, the RCS was connected to the orbiter's main computer, which monitored the system's performance and could automatically switch to a backup thruster if needed. This ensured that the spacecraft could still be controlled even if a thruster failed.\n\nAll these features made the RCS fault-tolerant and able to continue functioning even in the event of a failure, which made it an important safety feature on the Space Shuttle."

And on the final mission of the Space Shuttle program, STS-135, one of the RCS thrusters experienced a leak, but the mission was able to continue safely.\n\nDespite these failures, the RCS on the Space Shuttle generally performed well and the spacecraft was able to continue its mission safely with the help of the redundant systems."

As a result, the mission was shortened and the landing site was changed from Kennedy Space Center to Edwards Air Force Base in California.\n\nThe failure was significant because it marked the first time that a primary RCS thruster had failed on an operational Space Shuttle mission. Despite this, the crew was able to safely complete the mission and return to Earth. The RCS had several redundant systems that helped to minimize the impact of the failure, and the crew had been trained to handle this kind of situation.\n\nThe failure prompted NASA to implement a number of changes to the RCS system to prevent similar failures from happening in the future, including the modification of the fuel lines to minimize the risk of leaks, and the better monitoring of the RCS performance."

The production of meat requires large amounts of water, feed, and land, which can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. Additionally, the methane gas produced by livestock contributes to climate change.\n2. Animal Welfare: Another negative aspect of farming meat is the treatment of animals. Factory farming methods can involve the use of cramped and unsanitary conditions, which can lead to disease and stress among animals. Animals are also often subjected to painful procedures such as castration and dehorning without pain relief.\n3. Health Concerns: The consumption of meat has been linked to various health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, the use of antibiotics in farming can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make it difficult to treat infections in humans.\n4. Resource Intensive: Meat farming is a resource-intensive process that requires large amounts of energy, water, and land. This can lead to a strain on resources, particularly in areas where there is already limited access to these resources.\n5. Cost: Finally, meat farming can be costly, particularly for small-scale farmers. The cost of feed, veterinary care, and equipment can be high, and many farmers struggle to make a profit. Additionally, the cost of meat can be prohibitive for many consumers, particularly in low-income communities."

This makes it relatively easy to use and understand, even for people with little or no programming experience.\n\nSome common tasks that can be performed using SQL include:\n\n* Creating and modifying database structures, such as tables, indices, and constraints.\n* Inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database.\n* Querying a database to retrieve specific data or perform calculations.\n* Analyzing and aggregating data from multiple tables or sources.\n* Managing access to a database and granting permissions to users.\n\nSQL is used in a variety of industries and is a crucial skill for anyone working with data in a professional setting. It is supported by most RDBMSs, including MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, and is an important tool for working with and managing data in a variety of contexts."

They can also be used to display content from another website on a page, or to create a separate, independent section of a page within the same domain.\n\nOne of the main advantages of using an iFrame is that it allows a web page to display content from another source without the user having to leave the page. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as displaying dynamic or frequently updated content, or integrating third-party services or tools into a website.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to using iFrames. For example, they can make it more difficult to optimize a website for search engines, and they may not work properly on some devices or browsers. Additionally, iFrames can be a security risk if they are used to display content from untrusted sources, as they can potentially allow malicious content to be injected into a page."

This type of critical reflection and analysis can help us identify the root causes of societal problems and work towards developing more just and equitable solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while change towards a better future may be necessary, it must be approached with caution and a critical understanding of the current systems and their effects. The work of theorists such as Adorno can be useful in this endeavor."

Week after week, month after month go by and you still are no farther ahead of the game…stuck in the status quo that never seems to change.\n\nBreaking free means that the status quo of your life has to change… your habits of expectation have to change …your mindset has to change…you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new mindset.\n\nYou have to be willing to shift your daily focus inwards towards what you need to do today rather than tomorrow. Because when you create a great day today you welcome in a more powerful tomorrow.\n\nWe all have the same 24 hours each day. But why are some people building fabulous careers, achieving healthy lifestyles, enjoying great relationships and incomes, living their passions, and creating what they truly desire as a life?\n\nImagine that you could clear away the distractions that you unconsciously create. You know the stuff that consumes your time causes stress and disconnects you from your purpose and passion. \n\nImagine every day you embrace the energy for what you are choosing to create in your life. Your thoughts empower you, your choices inspire you and your actions create momentum, opportunity and possibility.\n\nYou can create a GREAT LIFE, the life you want to live by focusing your efforts on Creating a Great Day Today. That’s Day Sculpting. Seven intentional sculpted days turn into a month of wonderful weeks and a year of magnificent months creating an amazingly successful life.\n\nNone of this is going to work though if you believe that what you were born with is all you will get…\n\nNo one will ever attempt to do something when they are convinced that they will fail.\n\nResearch has shown that the brain will actually stop itself from doing what’s necessary to succeed if a person believes that they cannot succeed.\n\nIt’s the small concrete indicators of success today that will prove you can have whatever it is you want and the process of Day Sculpting will empowers, inspire and motivates you each step of the way.\n\nYou see: Confidence + Discipline = Desired Outcomes \n\nIt’s time to stop looking at your life from a fear based I don’t know how to mindset but rather be open to creating a solutions focused change consciousness that embraces your gift and talents and encourages you sharing them.\n\nLet me share a bit of nuero-chemistry with you…\nWhat fires together wires together…\n\nSo rather than Fall back on old habits…\nTake the transitional step…of being fully present to whats trying emerge as your ideal future and to help it along start building confidence each day…\n\nAnd your possibility muscle and an intended thought process that leads to a more focused and clear out picturing of your desires.\n\nYou see...It’s one thing to set goals and to make to do lists and to say your going to use the law of attraction to manifest what you want in life…\n\nI’m still looking at the many lists I have created.\n\nWhat it’s really about is having a clear and purposeful intention in order to create the energy and the MindState Of success that will propel you into action.\n----\n\nWhen done ask me for part 2"

        "value": "Here is part 2\n\n-----\nWhat I have found is the easiest way to have a great day is by knowing what direction you are headed in and then taking what we call success steps small incremental and measurable steps on a daily basis. \n\nI teach a process called What’s Different designed to maximize your efforts by eliminating external circumstances that block your path to achieving your chief aims…I encourage you to use it on a daily basis…\n\nHere’s how it works…Before you commit to a course of action IDENTIFY with the internal energy you want to mirror in your outer reality…VISUALIZE the outcome that you are seeking…IMAGINE what it will feel like when you realize the outcome…REMEMBER what didn’t work before Commit to a new way of seeing your actions and ANCHOR that memory by creating a new belief. \n\nThe status quo of your life has to change…the habits of expecting how things have to go has to change …your mindset has to change…you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new possibility paradigm.\n\nWe call this living from momentum mindsets…so that you begin to see what’s possible rather than what’s not.\n\nMomentum Mindsets are mindsets that encourage you to take risks, to discover your passions and to live from your adventurous spirit. It’s a mindset that empowers you to know that you were born with an innate drive to have what you want in life rather than accepting something that is less than your true calling. \n\nYou have to be inspired in what your building towards in your life and this to has happen each day… in every moment… it’s never about how busy you can be but rather how not to get ahead…and to stay focused on the moment your in.\n\nBe present to what you to do today not tomorrow so the momentum you build upon will make your task tomorrow that much easier. \n\nI use a simple formula…\nIntention…creates attention…causing momentum…resulting in desired outcomes.\n\nPeople who have achieve great success in life simply think differently and you can think like them. Successful people have a disciplined approach to their day. They know what their next step will be. They are always in a solutions oriented mindset.\n\nI believe there are two kinds of mindsets…\n\nFixed Mindset…fixed resources…fixed outcomes…fixed thinking\nGrowth Mindset…Momentum Mindsets are growth mindsets\n\nIt’s important to have:A daily ritual that you can follow…creating repetition and new mind muscle memory and a plan that will get you there…\n\nDay Sculpting uses the latest innovations in the psychology of being successful, how the brain works to empower you and what it means to have a support system on a daily basis that will enable you to create powerful, productive and successful days.\n\nWhat we know about creating success is how important….in fact how it is a game changer… that you live your life one day at a time. When you do you are more present and available to what’s seeking to emerge. You are less likely to get ahead of yourself and more likely to be fully present.\n\nIt is important to set intentions everyday so that you are always in the energy of creating your day the way you want it to play out.\n\nIt is important to understand the concept of Competing Commitments and how you can really learn how to streamline your day by being in the energy of what you want and being able to notice the distractions that have been habitual life stoppers so you can create a success oriented MindState.\n\nAnd how to specifically understand how neuro-chemistry can build new neuro pathways to support you in reaching your chief aims. And just what isThe Master Formula Of Attainment that’s been understood for hundreds of years and how this works in your life.\n\nAn outcome for you when U experience DaySculpting is that you create Momentum Mindsets that inspire, encourage and empower you to take small steps each day to prove you can live the life you truly desire as you create new habits and new possibilities for you.\n\nRather than think you have to do it all at once when you take small manageable success steps that momentum build s momentum that empowers you to keep moving forward…what we call forward momentum…\n\nIn order to connect on a mental and emotional level to what you really want to create in your life you first have to clear out the sabotaging information and thoughts that are competing for your time and energy.\n\nWhen you Quiet The Mind from your Mrnytal MindTrap Chatter…You clear a path for your intuition and inner wisdom to show up and guide you. You become a participant and not a spectator in your life and the flow of your creative energy is freed from old habits and conditioning. \n\nThe next concept we share is called The Law Of Reinforcement. What this means is that the more you do something and get a positive response the more likely you will continue to do that behavior.\n\nWe are always making choices and getting feedback. What if you were able to condition your mind and emotions to consistently choose what supports nurtures and empowers you each day? Wouldn’t you be more likely to continue in those behaviors? \n\nThat’s a key part of Day Sculpting…Repetition, Positive Conditioning, Disciplined Actions and Increased Resiliency puts you in alignment and harmony with your highest purpose and your desired results follow.\n\nStudies have shown that most adult learners tend to give up after 3 tries to learn something new. And it takes a minimum of 10 tries before you believe it’s something you can do. And then it takes 50 tries to get good at it. \nIt’s not about a quick fix it’s about building and sculpting your daily muscle of success and that takes time and work…\n\nHow we relate to our potential future. Most people when they think about a future goal see the challenges, the obstacles, the gap between where they are now and where they would rather be. The mind then projects into that gap a sense of lack, limitation and fear that they might not be able to achieve it.\n\nThe result is that for most people the future is a place of uncertainty but for us the future is the fertile unknown, a place of emerging possibility. Our job is to connect into the pure creative imaginal realm that we were all born into when we came into this world.\n\nPeople who have created great works in the world had a special relationship with the pure imaginal realm. Edison, Einstein, Great Artists and Philosophers, leaders like MLK, Ghandi, and Mother Teresa. They were all bringing through them what was trying to emerge in the world.\n\nIn Day Sculpting we call this Future Pacing.\n\nWe talk about The Positive Feedback Loop…This is a cool concept and vitally important in Day Sculpting. With a Positive Feedback Loop you are always noticing what’s working and what’s not.\n\nWhen something isn’t working that’s feedback that lets you know you need to stop doing it and do something different. When something is working, that’s feedback that lets you know to keep doing more of it.\n\nAs you choose to follow the path the feedback gives you, you are continuously being guided towards your desired destination by forces that support your desire. It’s like the game warmer warmer, hotter hotter.\n\nThe Positive Feedback Loop naturally clears out old habits, feelings of uncertainty, and competing commitments replacing them with a new mindset based around positive, inspired and successful choices that produce what it is you want in life.\n\nThe reason that this concept is so powerful can be understood by what we know about brain science. We know we have 2 very distinct brains inside of us. One is like the ultra rational scientist. It knows what’s best for you and what you should be doing to make your life work. The other brain is like a Neanderthal and its only looking for immediate gratification, comfort and safety.\n\nThe part of your brain that switches between these two is called the Reticular Activating System. I’ll just call it RAS.\nThe RAS is constantly bringing your attention to what’s most important. When a competing commitment shows up the RAS needs to switch you to focus on what you truly desire, not just the distraction of short term gratification that causes you to avoid the greater success that your now ready to enjoy.\n\nThat’s what Day Sculpting does naturally. It trains the Reticular Activating System, so that day by day, week by week, and month by month, you create the life you truly desire to live.\nSOME MORE STUFF FOR U MIKE…\n\nIn our previous videos, we shared with you the principles of the positive feedback loop, the Master Formula of Attainment, Competing Commitments, Law of Reinforcement, the concept of Connecting, Momentum Mindsets in which intention creates attention causing momentum and desired outcomes, the concrete indicators of success, the reticular activating system, growth and fixed mindsets, repetition, positive conditioning, disciplined actions, and increased resiliency, future pacing, and overcoming our built in immunity to change.\n\n---\nwhen done ask me for the final part, part 3"

        "value": "Here is the final part. Part 3\n---\n\nHere we will be showing how the principles and practices we’ve covered so far converge into one over-arching result that will benefit you for the rest of your life. You can think of it as flipping a switch that changes how you create new results in life one day at a time. This is at the very core of what we call Day Sculpting. \nThe simplest way to think of it is that most of the way we live is habitual. You have an habitual way of brushing your teeth, walking, talking to yourself and others, eating, working. Habits are wonderful…they make life easy but they also limit you. For example, if you have a habit of eating too much, you’ll put on weight. Not instantly, but steadily, day by day, until one day you have a weight problem. If you try to change your weight quickly through a trendy new diet, research shows that the weight is likely to come back, and then some, within a few short months, because the habits required to live at your ideal weight have not been properly established. \nHabits are habits because you don’t think about them, they happen nonconsciously. If you want a change in your life, you have to embody the change at a nonconscious level, so that the habits keeping your life the way it is today begin to shift.\nWouldn’t it be great if there was a switch in the brain that would move you from status quo to status GO!? This is a switch that once you flip it will produce the result you want, if you are willing to commit to and stay with the process.Day Sculpting is your guide to fully realizing the success you are ready to enjoy.\nA critically important capacity of the human mind called preconscious processing. This is the ability of the mind to receive information, beneath our conscious awareness, and act upon it without even knowing that it is happening. Used correctly, this is an amazing power. Used improperly, it will sabotage your best efforts and make life extremely difficult.\nMost of us think we are running the show with our conscious awareness, consciously choosing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and consequently, we believe are able to choose the results we create in life. However, what neuro-science research shows, is that we all have a vast nonconscious mind that is really running the show most of the time. That deeper part of us, in charge of our habitual thinking, feeling, and behaving is always operating in our best interest. But it does so using information that may be faulty or outdated. If you continue to feed it information that doesn’t serve you, it will continue to habitually bring results that are less than desired.\nYour preconscious processor is constantly routing new information directly into this larger database that your mind uses to create new behaviors. Your job is to place the right information into this database every single day, so that it can draw upon this new data and create new results. It requires your vigilance and purposeful intention on a daily basis. Day Sculpting is the process to accomplish exactly that, getting you to focus one day at a time on what you are trying to create in your life today, and the future you truly desire. \nA lot of experts in the human development field teach information and then expect it will translate into new behaviors automatically. But as we’ve pointed out, and as you’ve probably experienced, consciously knowing something and having the nonconscious mind put it into a new behavior, are two entirely different processes. What we are sharing with you is how to bridge that gap. This is precisely why so many experts in the field are recommending Day Sculpting to their clients, to help them use momentum mindsets on a daily basis and apply the good information they teach. \nWe talk about The The Solutions Focus process . Try it out: \nThink of an area of your life in which you are actively attempting to create different results. Imagine your chief aim regarding this area of your life as a perfect future. Now imagine a scale from one to ten, where ten is the perfect future and one is that you have not even started thinking about your chief aim. On this imaginary scale from 1 to 10, where would you place yourself right now?\nGo ahead and imagine where would you place yourself right now on that scale, where ten is your perfect future.\nWhatever number you came up with is fine. Whether it was 3 or 7, whatever you came up with I’ll always ask the same next question. “Why so high and not lower?”\nLet’s say, for example that you came up with a three. Asking the question “Why so High” catches the mind off guard. Most people expect, “Only a 3! Why so low?” If I had asked that what would you come up with? All the reasons why things aren’t working, who is to blame, problems, excuses, lack, limitations, and so on. \nBut when I ask “Why so high?” the brain immediately begins to sort for all of the things that are working for you, everything that has brought you up to a “three.” If you said you are at a seven on a scale of one to ten, the same question applies: “Why so high and not lower?”\nThe next step in solutions focus is equally powerful. “Think about what you can do today to move you one point up that scale—for example, from a three to a four, or from a seven to an eight?” When you ask this, your mind instantaneously starts generating ideas and options to answer your question. You quickly realize you can do more of the things that work, right? And if you are doing things that aren’t working, you now have the insight into how you can do things differently. \nThis solutions focus approach provides quick insight into how to move things forward in areas you may have been stuck or working on unsuccessfully. It is a brilliant way to access more of your nonconscious database and facilitate discovering resources you did not know were there. \nSo as you can see, this video has been centered on connecting the dots and providing you with the insights on how you can flip the switch in your brain and how you can create your life one day at a time in the most powerful way possible. \nYou must contact that inner part of you that is in charge of your habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in order to re-sculpt yourself.\nThis is a unique psychological principle called anchoring. In the research this is also called behavioral conditioning, and as we’ve called it, the law of reinforcement…which says you get more of what you reinforce. When you want to reinforce a positive new behavior, you anchor it in a positive new momentum mindset. As you do this on a daily basis, you are literally training your mind, conditioning your thoughts, amplifying positive feelings and emotions to live into a future state that you are anchoring in your daily experience. \nDay Sculpting goes beyond personal development. It takes whatever it is you are currently learning and makes it possible for you to embody, apply and enjoy the benefits you are committed to achieve. \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is more stuff to do. What we need is that everything we do gets us the results we are going for. In essence what’s needed is a system that will streamline our efforts so we accomplish our chief aims in less time.\n\nMichaelangelo said the process of sculpting is to remove what’s not supposed to be there. He had the mindset that the finished sculpture already existed in the marble and he just had to reveal it. In the same way your destiny already resides in you. You just need to clear a path for it to emerge.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. So why do some people consistently have great days while others are up and down and stay stuck in mediocrity? It’s a disciplined habit of how you approach everyday. Day Sculpting takes the same 24 hours that we all have and helps clarify your choices so that your actions reveal your highest destiny. \n\nIt is a quick, easy and effortless way that supports and empowers your efforts in achieving your chief aims. It creates the mindsets necessary to have successful days, weeks, months and years.\n\nDay Sculpting is a 90- day program designed to empower you to create your life ONE DAY AT A TIME. By committing 30 minutes each day to create what you want that day. \n\nWe believe that when you focus your actions one day at a time the results you get become measurable and achievable. Your energy is committed to channeling your efforts so you create a confident groove in your mind that empowers your habitual actions to create what you really want.\n\nThis daily program is broken down into 3 MANAGEABLE, SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS. 15 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes midday and 10 minutes at night. \n\nDay Sculpting…It’s designed so that the way you start your day creates the momentum that carries you throughout your day. \n\nAnd finally research has shown that the best time to integrate what you’ve learned in your day and to set yourself up for success tomorrow is before you go to sleep. The Nighttime Review process takes just 10 minutes, which is less time then it takes to take a shower or to take your dog on an evening walk.\n\nWe already have enough complexity in life…don’t we? We don’t want you working harder we want you thinking smarter! So that the success you achieve is more effortless. \n\nSo what does it take for someone to accomplish the high level results we are talking about?\n\n• First you have to wake up and be totally jazzed about the day\n• You have to be inspired to do your best\n• You have to be focused on creating what you truly desire\n• You got to get to it, stay on it, and be in the energy of it before your distractions take over. \n• And if distractions takeover you have to quickly get back on track.\n• You have to learn from what’s working and what’s not\n• You have to be able to listen to feedback and course correct during your day\n• And at the end of the day you have be able to feel you did your best and you can do even better tomorrow\n\nAnd with Day Sculpting you can accomplish this and more in less than 30 minutes which is distributed throughout your day. Most people will give up on their dreams after they have tried something only 3 times because they didn’t get instant gratification. \n\nThere are no magic bullets here. You are investing in a future YOU desire. \n\nDay Sculpting gives you the opportunity everyday to purposefully stay in the energy of what you want to create the benefit to you being a more empowered mindset that inspires passionate action and a willingness to breakthrough any barriers that may have held you back in the past so you fully embody the life you choose to live.\n\nYou may have heard Gandhi say “Be the change you want to see in the world.” Well now you can. \n\nYears ago I heard a statistic that blew me away. If you read in a single subject of your choice for 15 minutes a day 5 days a week you would become one of the leading experts in the world in that subject within 3 years…\n\nMore recent research has demonstrated that world class talent requires 10000 hours and 10 years to develop…\n\nSo the question is how does somebody create this kind of commitment and persistence? Clearly one day at a time.\n\nSo where are you not following through in your life? How would you like to do things differently? What can you do shift your energy when you say I can’t get it done or you procrastinate? What’s it going to take for you to say I’ve had enough it’s time for me to do something different? Where will you get the support you need to build the confidence to stay on track?\n\nEach day you get these elements to help guide you… \n- The Good Morning Great Day Email\n- The Morning In Vision Video \n- The Morning Future Pacing Visualization\n- The Morning Success Journal Process\n- The Midday SMS and Computer Stay on Track Reminders\n- The Midday Reconnect Refresher Mediation\n- The Evening Review And Renew Process\n- The Evening Journal Process\n- The Bedtime Nonconcious Mind Question Declaration\n \nWhen you put this together it can’t help but become a daily practice that will create your new daily ritual that is your roadmap to success. We are giving you the daily steps that will create your momentum mindsets.\n\nThe Day Sculpting program leaves you no wiggle room. The days of “I’ll get to it later” are gone. When you are serious about changing your life, you now have a realistic opportunity to do so with this program. \n\nWE invite you to fully commit to your life. To once and for all follow through and step up. To say yes to that dream inside of you and to look at each day as an opportunity to live your dreams enthusiastically rather than settling for more of the same old same old.\n---"

        "value": "The New Testament provides several references to the Apostle John, including the Gospel of John, the three letters of John (1 John, 2 John, and 3 John), and the book of Revelation. While the New Testament does not provide a detailed chronology of John's life, it is possible to piece together some information about his life based on these sources.\n\nHere is a possible chronology of John's life, based on the information provided in the New Testament:\n\n* Early life: John was likely born in the early first century in Galilee, the son of Zebedee and Salome (Mark 10:35-45). He and his brother James were fishermen before they became followers of Jesus (Matthew 4:18-22).\n* Ministry with Jesus: John was one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus (Mark 3:13-19). He was present at many important events in Jesus' life, including the transfiguration (Mark 9:2-8) and the Last Supper (Mark 14:17-25). John is often referred to as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" in the Gospel of John, and he is portrayed as being particularly close to Jesus.\n* Crucifixion and resurrection: John was one of the few disciples who was present at the crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:25-27). After Jesus' death and resurrection, John continued to follow him and was present when Jesus appeared to the disciples (John 20:19-23).\n* Ministry after Jesus' death: After Jesus' death and resurrection, John became a prominent leader in the early Christian church. He was one of the apostles who preached and performed miracles in Jerusalem (Acts 3:1-10), and he was imprisoned along with Peter for preaching the gospel (Acts 4:1-22).\n* Writing of the Gospel of John: The Gospel of John, which is believed to have been written by the Apostle John, was likely written in the late first century. It is possible that John wrote the gospel while he was living in Ephesus, which was one of the centers of early Christianity (John 19:26-27).\n* Writing of the letters of John: The three letters of John (1 John, 2 John, and 3 John) were likely written in the late first century, after the Gospel of John. These letters were addressed to various churches and individuals and provided guidance on issues such as love, truth, and false teachers.\n* Exile and writing of Revelation: According to tradition, John was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of Emperor Domitian (81-96 AD). While on Patmos, John is said to have received a vision from Jesus, which he recorded in the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation, which was likely written in the late first century, contains apocalyptic visions and prophecies about the end times.\n* Death: According to tradition, John died in Ephesus in the late first century, although the exact date of his death is not known."

Based on the web search results you provided, it seems that there are a few different ways you could approach building a Google Places autocomplete feature using Jetpack Compose and the MVVM model.\n\nOne option would be to create a custom composable using a DropDownMenu and BaseTextField, as suggested in one of the Stack Overflow responses [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64419367/does-jetpack-compose-offer-a-material-autocomplete-textview-replacement)]. This approach would involve creating a ViewModel to hold the list of suggested places based on the user's input, and then passing that list to the custom composable to display in the DropDownMenu.\n\nAnother option would be to use a hybrid approach that combines XML-autocomplete and Compose screens through the ComposeView, as suggested in another Stack Overflow response [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64419367/does-jetpack-compose-offer-a-material-autocomplete-textview-replacement)]. This approach would involve creating an XML layout with a Material AutoCompleteTextView, and then using the ComposeView to inflate that layout and wrap it in a Compose Column to display the selected place in a LazyColumn.\n\nFinally, there is a tutorial available on the Google Codelabs website that walks through building adaptive apps with Jetpack Compose, including how to use Compose to enhance reachability and build responsive UIs on different device types [[1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/jetpack-compose-adaptability)]. While this tutorial doesn't specifically cover Google Places autocomplete, it may still be a useful resource for learning more about building Compose apps in general.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Sure, I can provide some guidance on how to build a Google Places autocomplete feature on Jetpack Compose using the MVVM model.\n\nFirst, you'll need to set up the Google Places API in your project and obtain an API key. You can follow the instructions in the official documentation to do this: <https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#create-project-api-key>\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can use the Autocomplete API to fetch suggested places based on the user's input. Here's an example of how you can implement this in your ViewModel:\n```kotlin\nclass MyViewModel : ViewModel() {\n    private val apiKey = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n    private val placesClient = Places.createClient(application)\n\n    private val _places = MutableLiveData<List<Place>>()\n    val places: LiveData<List<Place>> = _places\n\n    fun searchPlaces(query: String) {\n        val request = FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.builder()\n            .setQuery(query)\n            .setTypeFilter(TypeFilter.ADDRESS)\n            .build()\n\n        placesClient.findAutocompletePredictions(request)\n            .addOnSuccessListener { response ->\n                val results = response.autocompletePredictions.map { prediction ->\n                    Place(prediction.getPrimaryText(null).toString(),\n                          prediction.getSecondaryText(null).toString(),\n                          prediction.placeId)\n                }\n                _places.value = results\n            }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we're using a FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest to search for places that match the user's query. We're also filtering the results to only include addresses, since that's what we're interested in.\n\nThe results are returned as a list of AutocompletePrediction objects, which we map to our own Place data class. The Place class contains the name, address, and ID of each suggested place.\n\nNext, we can use this ViewModel in our Composable to display the suggested places in a LazyColumn. Here's an example:\n```scss\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen(viewModel: MyViewModel) {\n    val query = remember { mutableStateOf(\"\") }\n\n    Column {\n        TextField(value = query.value, onValueChange = { query.value = it },\n                  label = { Text(\"Enter a place\") })\n        LazyColumn {\n            items(viewModel.places.value ?: emptyList()) { place ->\n                Text(place.name)\n                Text(place.address)\n                Button(onClick = { /* Select this place */ }) {\n                    Text(\"Select\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this Composable, we're using a TextField to allow the user to enter their search query. We're also using a LazyColumn to display the suggested places, using the items() function to iterate over the list of places.\n\nFor each place, we're displaying the name and address in separate Text composables, and providing a Button that the user can click to select that place.\n\nFinally, we just need to wire up our Composable to our ViewModel using the rememberViewModel() function:\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen() {\n    val viewModel = rememberViewModel { MyViewModel() }\n    MyScreen(viewModel)\n}\n```\nThat should give you a basic idea of how to implement a Google Places autocomplete feature on Jetpack Compose using the MVVM model. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"

The \"Set out\" row is added to the table to account for all five ships that were part of the expedition. The number of ships that set out is 5, as stated in the problem statement.\n5.

This virtual world may be based on real-world locations or may be entirely fictional. People can use avatars, or virtual representations of themselves, to interact with each other and with the virtual world.\n\nThe concept of the metaverse has gained popularity in recent years with the development of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, which allow people to experience immersive virtual environments.

        "value": "Paper Name: My Tweets Bring All the Traits to the Yard: Predicting Personality and Relational Traits in Online Social Networks\n\nAbstract: Users in Online Social Networks (OSNs,) leave traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples’ psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users’ psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals’ social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one’s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users—humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people’s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users’ psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people’s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users’ holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology and a holistic profiling approach.\n\nPsychological profiling in the wild. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed psychological profiling methodology through a use case. We identify a set of Twitter users who seem to be accepted as opinion leaders on social media (i.e., have a large following). We apply our methodology to predict their psychological profiles and analyze results. We find that the distributions of traits significantly deviates from regular users (defined as users included in our ground-truth dataset), and that the set of leaders can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles. These findings highlight the usefulness of our approach in the characterization of the personalities for different groups of OSN users (e.g., such a group psychological profile could be used to recommend skills/activities/jobs to users based on their profile similarity) and classification of users based on their profiles.\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of related psychological literature, discuss related work, and highlight several open issues of existing methods. We also highlight the contribution of the present work. Section 3 details the collected dataset and the data mining and feature engineering methodology, and Section 4 presents the design and evaluation of the proposed machine learning predictive model. Finally, we conclude our article and discuss future work in Section 6.\n\nFirst, Please Summarize the paper in 10 points, in easy to read and understand simple English.\nSecond, Explain what the paper does as if I'm 11 years old.\n\nThanks :))"

It’s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt’s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates’ requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you’ve sorted out your goals, you’ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you’ll have to say “no,” or “later.” If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you’ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you’re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization’s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-à-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn’t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?"

        "value": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company’s or agency’s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n• Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n• Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO’s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n• Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn’t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors’ Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n• Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company’s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public’s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can “snow” the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it’s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as “a reliable source.” Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: “Acme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.”\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: “Acme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, ‘Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors’ in endurance, quality, and safety; it’s also available at a lower\nprice.’ ”\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n“In repeated tests against our competitors . . . ”\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you’ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who’s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there’s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance—press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies—that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don’t know, say, “I don’t\nhave that information at the moment, but I’ll get it to you as soon as I do”—\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you’re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They’ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don’t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point. Rambling and repetition\nare likely to get you into trouble or open new lines of inquiry.\ni. If you’re facing a problem you’ve caused, however inadvertently, be prepared\nto acknowledge\n\nAre you ready for text 3?"

        "value": "Here is Text 3: Diversity and Intercultural Communication \n\nGenerally, the best answer to these questions is yes, but it always depends on the personal as well as the business aspects of your relationship. One good rule of thumb: When the other person gives\nyou an opening, pursue it, and build on your mutual experience.\nThis issue comes up even more in international communication. As companies\nfrom manufacturers to media conglomerates become increasingly global, managers\nneed to understand the norms of other cultures. Although English is on the verge of\nbecoming the international language, standards of behavior and social interaction\nvary greatly between the United States and England, let alone between, say, France\nand Japan. In one country an invitation to dinner may be considered an expected\npoliteness, while in another, it may be an invasion of a colleague’s private time.\nAsking about someone’s family may be absolutely required in one culture and offensively\nintrusive in another.\nNo textbook can cover all such contingencies; one good rule if you’re not sure\nmay be the trial lawyer’s: Don’t ask a question to which you don’t already know the\nanswer. Another, and sometimes contradictory, rule is: Be frank about your cultural\nconfusion. Your colleague likely will have been in the same situation himself and\nwill be happy to help out. Finally, do your research; you’re likely to have a friend or\ncoworker who knows the terrain better than you do. Our purpose here is to sensitize\nmanagers to their increasing need to understand the norms of cultures other than\ntheir own. (For a case addressing the special features of international communication,\nsee International Oil later in this chapter.)\nThe opportunities for cultural confusion—personal, commercial, ethical, and\nlinguistic—are almost endless. Imagine marketing a Chevy Nova in Hispanic countries,\nwhere “no va” means “it doesn’t run.” Many products that are perfectly safe to\nmarket in first-world countries raise ethical problems when sold in developing\ncountries—infant baby formula, for example, which if mixed with contaminated\nwater can cause death. Working in other cultures means understanding your hosts’\nconceptions of greetings, timing, hygiene, negotiation, agreement, politeness, personal\nspace, gesture, meal etiquette, and closure.\nWhile English has essentially become the international language, it’s important\nto remember that there are many Englishes. A joke in one form of English can be a\ndeadly insult in another. Although it may seem too obvious to emphasize, you must\nunderstand the cultural norms and language use of people from other cultures before\nyou can communicate effectively with them. This is true even if they are, say,\nthe South American employees of your Canadian company. A bribe in one culture\ncan be a thoughtful gift in another.\nA recent article by Sydel Sokuvitz (Business Communication Quarterly, New\nYork, March, 2002) suggests some principles for conducting successful intercultural\nbusiness communication. Sokuvitz first describes the special challenges global\nmanagers face, including:\nCoping with a range of tensions that arise out of internationally dispersed activities,\nThe challenges of maintaining coordinated activities across time-zones, cultural\nboundaries, and different countries’ laws, and\nThe difficulties posed when the right medium for your message in one culture\nmay be wrong in another.\nDrawing on a range of research in the field, Sokuvitz comes up with several\nprovocative conclusions:\nExcessive dependence on technological communication such as E-mail can result\nin problems for both communication and productivity.\nFace-to-face meetings with colleagues from other cultures are critical to achieving\neffective communication.\nStudying with students from other cultures is critical to preparing a manager\nfor working in the increasingly globalized economy.\nSokuvitz cites the following example from an article by Fernandez-Aroaz\n(“Hiring without Firing,” Harvard Business Review, 1999):\nA U.S.-based telecommunications company was seeking a CEO for its new division\nin Latin America. An international search was conducted, and a veteran was\nhired, someone known as an effective manager and marketing expert. “But his run\nlasted less than a year and was nothing short of a disaster. The simple reason was\nthat he lacked the two skills that the job really required: negotiation and cross-cultural\nsensitivity.”\nEventually the company was saved from near-bankruptcy by bringing in a\nnew CEO who was a native Latin American with work experience in the U.S. His\nability to bridge cultural differences is credited with saving the company.\nCommunications between headquarters and subsidiaries is only one example\nof the challenges posed by globalization. Companies in one country are under increasing\nsocial pressure to take responsibility for the behavior of their subcontractors\nin other countries. Recently, for example, Nike suffered adverse publicity because\nof the work practices of shoe manufacturers it employs in Asia.\nThe successful manager of the future increasingly will be required to be a citizen\nof the world. While electronic communication may work fine for conveying information\nor directions, there is no substitute for “speaking the language” of the\npeople with whom you’re trying to communicate.\n\nAre you ready to answer some questions on text 1, text 2 and text 3?"

Limited edition collaborations: Partner with other Etsy sellers or local artisans to create exclusive, limited-edition product collaborations. This adds a layer of exclusivity and encourages buyers to make a purchase before items sell out.\n3. Storytelling through product descriptions: Write compelling, detailed stories behind each design, highlighting its inspiration and creative process. This helps customers connect emotionally with your products, increasing their perceived value.\n4. Personalized customer service: Offer exceptional, personalized customer service through prompt communication, tailored product recommendations, and addressing customer queries. This builds trust and fosters long-term customer relationships.\n5. Gamification and loyalty programs: Introduce a points-based system or exclusive discounts for repeat customers. By gamifying the shopping experience, you encourage customer loyalty and incentivize purchases.\n6. Interactive design process: Involve customers in the design process by soliciting feedback, suggestions, or even hosting design contests. This creates a sense of ownership and fosters a loyal community around your shop.\n7. Showcasing the production process: Share behind-the-scenes content like videos or blog posts, detailing the creative and production process. This provides transparency, humanizes your brand, and highlights the craftsmanship involved.\n8. Seasonal or themed collections: Launch exclusive collections tied to holidays, cultural events, or emerging trends. This keeps your shop fresh and encourages customers to check back frequently for new products.\n9. Social impact initiatives: Align your shop with a cause, donating a percentage of profits to a charity or supporting sustainable practices. This adds value to your products and attracts customers who share your values.\n10. Create immersive virtual experiences: Leverage technology like augmented reality (AR) to let customers virtually \"try on\" or preview your designs on their own spaces or bodies.

Here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of finding a job as an LMFT therapist:\n\n1. Obtain a student visa: In order to study in the United States, you will need to obtain a student visa. You can find more information about obtaining a student visa on the U.S. Department of State's website.\n2. Enroll in a graduate program in marriage and family therapy: In order to become an LMFT, you will need to complete a graduate-level program in marriage and family therapy that is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE). You can find a list of COAMFTE-accredited programs on the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) website.\n3. Obtain a clinical internship: Many graduate programs in marriage and family therapy require students to complete a clinical internship as part of their coursework. This will give you the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with clients and practicing therapy.\n4. Pass the licensure exam: Once you have completed your graduate program and clinical internship, you will need to pass the licensure exam in order to become an LMFT. The exam is administered by the Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards (AMFTRB).\n5. Find a job: After you have become an LMFT, you can start looking for job openings in your area. You may want to consider contacting local mental health clinics, hospitals, or private practices to see if they have any openings for LMFTs. You can also search for job openings on websites such as the AAMFT Job Connection or the National Council for Behavioral Health's Job Bank.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

        "value": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of very small particles, such as atoms and subatomic particles.\n\nIn a classical computer, information is processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits, to store and process information. Qubits can represent both a 0 and a 1 simultaneously, a property known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nQuantum computers also have another quantum mechanical property called entanglement, which allows them to perform certain operations in parallel. This means that they can perform many calculations at the same time, further increasing their speed and power.\n\nQuantum computing is still a relatively new field and is not yet widely used. However, it has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and industry, including cryptography, drug discovery, and machine learning."

For example, sediment can be carried by a river and deposited at the river's mouth, forming a delta. Similarly, wind can transport sand and dust particles, which can settle on surfaces as dunes or dust deposits. Glaciers can also transport and deposit rocks and soil as they move.\n\nIn addition to geological processes, deposition can also occur in industrial and technological contexts. For example, in semiconductor manufacturing, deposition refers to the process of depositing thin films of material onto a substrate using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.\n\nOverall, deposition is an important natural and industrial process that helps shape our world and can have significant impacts on the environment and technological progress."

It occurs when the particles or sediment become too heavy to remain suspended in the fluid, such as water or air, and begin to sink or settle to the bottom.\n\nSedimentation can occur in a variety of natural environments, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and wetlands. In these environments, sediments may come from a variety of sources, including erosion of rocks and soil, decomposition of organic matter, and human activities such as mining or construction.\n\nIn the water cycle, sedimentation plays an important role in the formation of sedimentary rocks, which are created when layers of sediment are compressed and cemented together over time. These rocks can provide valuable information about the Earth's history, including information about past climates, geological events, and the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nIn industrial settings, sedimentation is often used as a method for separating particles or solids from liquids. For example, wastewater treatment plants use sedimentation tanks to remove suspended solids and pollutants from wastewater before it is discharged into the environment.\n\nOverall, sedimentation is an important process that plays a critical role in shaping our natural environment and in a wide range of industrial applications."

The e-Mamta initiative is a web-based application that provides a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) system for pregnant women, mothers, and children from birth to five years of age. The system allows health workers to record and track the health status of these groups of people and provide timely and appropriate healthcare services.\n\nSome of the key features of the e-Mamta initiative are as follows:\n\n1. Registration of pregnant women: The system registers pregnant women at the time of their first antenatal check-up (ANC) and creates a unique identification number (UID) for each woman. The system captures the woman's demographic data, ANC details, medical history, and other relevant information.\n2. ANC visits: The system schedules the next ANC visits based on the gestational age of the woman and reminds the health worker and the woman through SMS alerts.\n3.

In other works, the fourth dimension is used as a metaphor for concepts such as time, change, and perspective, which can inspire reflection, contemplation, or a new way of thinking.\n\nIn general, the emotional response to the fourth dimension will depend on the individual's background, cultural context, and personal interpretation of the concept. For some people, the fourth dimension may evoke excitement and fascination with the possibilities of new discoveries and understanding of the universe, while for others, it may seem abstract and difficult to grasp, leading to frustration or disinterest."

For example, string theory proposes that the universe has ten dimensions, of which the first four are the three spatial dimensions and time, and the remaining six dimensions are compactified or curled up so tightly that they are not directly observable at our scale.\n\nOther theories, such as brane theory, propose the existence of higher-dimensional objects known as branes, which could have more than four dimensions.

Well, string theory says that there might be six more dimensions that are too small for us to see or feel, which are all curled up and hidden away.\n\nString theory also helps explain some of the things in the universe that we don't understand yet, like why gravity is so weak compared to the other forces, and what dark matter and dark energy are.\n\nIt's a pretty complicated idea, and even the scientists who study it don't completely understand it yet.

        "value": "Here's some background on the design of an automatic plant sprinkler based on Arduino Uno and humidity sensors:\n\nAutomatic plant sprinklers are an effective way to ensure that your plants receive adequate water even when you're not around. Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board that can be used to control various electronic devices. By combining an Arduino Uno board with a humidity sensor, you can create an automated plant watering system that will only water the plants when the soil is dry enough.\n\nThe humidity sensor used in this project can be either DHT11 or DHT22. Both sensors measure temperature and humidity and output a digital signal that can be read by the Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno can then use this data to determine when the soil needs to be watered.\n\nThe water pump is another important component of the system. It should be able to supply enough water to the plants without overwatering them. In this design, a relay module is used to control the water pump. The relay module is connected to the Arduino Uno and can be controlled by a digital output pin. When the Arduino Uno sends a signal to the relay module, it switches on the water pump.\n\nTo ensure that the water pump is not damaged by back EMF, a transistor is used to control its operation. The transistor acts as a switch, allowing the Arduino Uno to turn the water pump on or off. A diode is also used to protect the transistor from back EMF.\n\nThe code for this project involves reading the humidity sensor data and comparing it to a threshold value. If the humidity level is below the threshold, the Arduino Uno will send a signal to the relay module, which will turn on the water pump. Once the soil is adequately watered, the Arduino Uno will turn off the water pump.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. \"Automatic Plant Watering System Using Arduino Uno\" by Karthik M and Vinayakumar B.

Temporal Workflow could be used to model and execute the various tasks involved in the mortgage application process, such as credit checks, income verification, document review, and so on. Workflows could be defined to represent the various tasks involved in each stage of the mortgage application process, and activities could be assigned to specific roles (e.g., front office banker, back office).\n3. The two frameworks could be integrated by using the state machine to trigger workflows and vice versa. For example, a transition to the \"Under Review\" state could trigger a workflow that assigns tasks to the front office banker and back office. Completion of these tasks could, in turn, trigger a transition to the \"Approved\" or \"Rejected\" state.\n4.

        "value": "The French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that had far-reaching consequences, not only for the country but for Europe and the world as a whole. This essay will explore the causes, key events, and outcomes of the French Revolution.\n\nCauses of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution was a response to the economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades. One of the main causes of the revolution was the country's deepening financial crisis. The French government was heavily in debt due to the cost of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, and the burden of this debt fell on the common people in the form of heavy taxes.\n\nAnother significant cause of the French Revolution was the country's outdated feudal system. The nobility and clergy held vast amounts of power and wealth, while the majority of the population, the peasants and middle class, were oppressed and excluded from political decision-making.\n\nKey Events of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase, which lasted from 1789 to 1792, was marked by the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nThe second phase, which lasted from 1792 to 1794, was characterized by the rise of the radical Jacobin faction, led by Maximilien Robespierre. During this phase, the king, Louis XVI, was executed, and a Reign of Terror ensued, during which thousands of people were executed for perceived counter-revolutionary activities.\n\nThe third phase, which lasted from 1794 to 1799, saw the fall of Robespierre and the rise of the Directory, a five-man governing body. During this phase, the French armies expanded their control over Europe, but the country continued to experience political instability and economic problems.\n\nOutcomes of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution had a profound impact on France and the world. In France, the Revolution brought an end to the monarchy and the feudal system, established the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and created a modern, secular state.\n\nThe Revolution also had far-reaching effects on Europe and the world. It inspired similar revolutions in other countries, such as the Haitian Revolution, and helped to spread democratic ideas and values across the globe.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that had profound consequences for France and the world. It was a response to economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades and was marked by key events such as the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, the execution of Louis XVI, and the Reign of Terror.\n\nThe Revolution's outcomes included the establishment of a modern, secular state in France and the spread of democratic ideas and values across the globe. Despite the challenges and controversies of the Revolution, it remains an important chapter in the history of the modern world."

Virtual lectures: Instructors can create pre-recorded lectures or use live video conferencing tools to deliver lectures to students who may not be able to attend in person. This can be especially useful for students who are studying remotely or who have scheduling conflicts.\n3. Interactive activities: Technology can be used to create interactive activities that engage students and help them develop their critical thinking skills.

Collaborative projects: Instructors can use online tools to facilitate group projects and collaborative assignments. These can be done entirely online, or students can use technology to work together remotely.\n5. Digital archives: Many historical archives and primary sources are now available online, and instructors can use these resources to help students develop their research and analysis skills. Instructors can also use digital tools to help students organize and analyze the information they gather.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how instructors can use technology to enhance the classroom experience in the age of chat GPT.

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "That's correct! To control 12V solenoids with the Raspberry Pi, you will need to use relay modules that are compatible with the Pi's GPIO pins.\n\nRelay modules allow you to use a low-voltage signal (in this case, from the Pi's GPIO pins) to control a high-voltage circuit (the 12V solenoids). The relay acts like a switch that is controlled by the Pi's GPIO pins. When the GPIO pin is set to HIGH, the relay is closed and the solenoid is turned on, and when the GPIO pin is set to LOW, the relay is opened and the solenoid is turned off.\n\nHere's an example of how to connect a relay module to the Raspberry Pi and control a solenoid:\n\n1. Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The exact wiring will depend on the specific relay module you are using, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, you will need to connect the relay module's VCC and GND pins to the Pi's 5V and GND pins, and connect the relay module's IN pin to a GPIO pin on the Pi.\n2. Connect the solenoid to the relay module. Again, the exact wiring will depend on the specific components you are using. Typically, you will connect one end of the solenoid to the relay module's NO (Normally Open) pin and the other end to the relay module's COM (Common) pin. When the relay is closed, the circuit is completed and the solenoid is turned on.\n3. Write a Python program that uses the RPi.GPIO library to control the GPIO pins and turn the solenoids on and off through the relay modules. The exact code will depend on your specific setup and timed sequence requirements, but here's an example of how to turn a single solenoid on and off:\n```python\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nimport time\n\n# Set up GPIO pins\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)\nGPIO.setup(relay_pin, GPIO.OUT)\n\n# Turn solenoid on\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.HIGH)\ntime.sleep(on_time)\n\n# Turn solenoid off\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.LOW)\ntime.sleep(off_time)\n\n# Clean up GPIO pins\nGPIO.cleanup()\n```\n4. Modify the Python program to control multiple solenoids in a timed sequence. You can use the same basic logic as the example above, but you will need to add additional relay modules and GPIO pins for each solenoid.\n5. Add a feature to the GUI that allows you to set the time for each solenoid in the sequence.\n6. Test the entire system to ensure that the timed sequence and relay control are working correctly. Make sure to test the system under a variety of operating conditions to ensure reliability.\n\nWith these additional steps, you will have a control module that can control 12V solenoids using relay modules that are triggered by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins."

Here's how it works:\n\n* `^` matches the start of the line.\n* `(?!.*apple)` is a negative lookahead that matches if the line contains the word \"apple\". The `.*` inside the lookahead matches any number of characters, so the lookahead scans the entire line to check for the presence of \"apple\".\n* `.*` matches any number of characters (including zero), so the entire line is matched.\n\nTo use this pattern in Notepad++:\n\n1. Open the file you want to search.\n2. Press `Ctrl + F` to open the Find dialog box.\n3. Click the \"Mark\" tab.\n4. Select the \"Regular expression\" search mode.\n5.

We are reaching out to request your assistance in setting up e-waste boxes around the Guilford College campus and establishing a computer donation program with Bauman IT or any other facility on the campus.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Kash, the principal at Guilford College, and he expressed interest in working with CompuCycle to promote sustainable e-waste disposal and computer donations on the campus. With your help as the liaison between ECG and Guilford College, we believe we can make a positive impact on the environment and the community.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with e-waste boxes that we could place around campus for students and staff to deposit their electronic waste. We would also like to discuss the possibility of setting up a computer donation program where we could collect used computers, refurbish them, and donate them to individuals or organizations in need.\n\nIf you could let us know what steps we need to take to move forward with this initiative, that would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to working with you to make Guilford College a more sustainable and socially responsible community.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAyaam Ghimire."

They may have anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred employees and may be privately or publicly owned.\n\nLarge corporation: These are very large, well-established companies that typically have thousands of employees and a significant amount of resources. They may be publicly traded on a stock exchange and may have operations in multiple countries.\n\nFortune 500 company: These are the largest and most successful companies in the world, as ranked by Fortune magazine. To be included on the Fortune 500 list, a company must have annual revenues of at least $5 billion. These companies are typically household names and have a significant impact on the global economy.\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

This may involve significant expansion into new markets, both domestic and international, as well as acquisitions of other companies. Large corporations typically have a significant amount of resources and are able to invest in research and development, marketing, and other areas that can help them maintain their competitive edge.\n\nFinally, a company may become a Fortune 500 company if it is able to achieve and maintain extremely high levels of success over a long period of time. This may involve consistently strong financial performance, innovative products and services, and a strong brand that is recognized globally. Fortune 500 companies are typically leaders in their respective industries and have a significant impact on the economy.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the transitions between these different types of companies!

For example, a large corporation may have more formalized processes and procedures in place, as well as a greater emphasis on strategic planning and decision-making.\n\nOverall, the transition from a medium-sized business to a large corporation typically requires a company to be highly successful and to have a strong track record of growth and stability.

The survey will ask about young people's experiences with mental health conditions, their use of mental health services, and their suggestions for how to improve mental health care for young people. The online survey will collect stories anonymously. Anyone who submits a story through the survey will be redirected to a list of resources. The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by thematic analysis. The focus groups will continue until thematic saturation.\n\nPhase 3: Persona Scenario method with Black youth\n Black youth will be invited to focus groups (or one-on-one interviews, if requested) using persona scenario methods. The findings from the focus groups with mental health clinicians will be used to create clinician personas, including information about their motivations, challenges and describe the different ways in which the clinician might interact with the Black youth based on youth narratives.

        "value": "The importance of higher education cannot be overstated in today's society. While a high school diploma used to be sufficient for many jobs, the reality is that employers are now seeking candidates with advanced degrees and specialized skills. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why higher education is necessary for success in today's economy.\n\nFirstly, higher education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in today's job market. Many professions require advanced degrees, such as law, medicine, and engineering. Even in fields where a degree is not required, having one can give job seekers an edge over the competition. In addition to providing specialized knowledge, higher education also teaches critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are highly valued by employers.\n\nSecondly, higher education is essential for personal growth and development. College and university campuses provide students with opportunities to explore their interests, develop new skills, and form lifelong connections with peers and mentors. Students are exposed to a diverse range of ideas, cultures, and perspectives, which can broaden their understanding of the world and help them become more empathetic and open-minded individuals.\n\nFinally, higher education is critical for economic growth and development. In today's knowledge-based economy, innovation and technological advancements are the key drivers of growth. Higher education institutions are hubs for research and development, and they play a critical role in fostering innovation and driving economic progress. By investing in higher education, governments can create a highly skilled workforce and attract businesses and industries that require specialized talent.\n\nIn conclusion, higher education is essential for success in today's society. It provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and connections necessary to compete in the job market and contribute to economic growth and development. While the cost of higher education can be a barrier for many, there are options available, such as scholarships, grants, and student loans, to help make it more accessible. As a society, we must continue to invest in higher education to ensure that we remain competitive and continue to drive progress in the years to come."

Construct the URL for the YouTube thumbnail.\n3. Download the thumbnail image.\n4. Convert the image to a Base64 string.\n\nFirst, make sure to install the `System.Net.Http` NuGet package if you haven't already.\n\nHere's a sample C# code to achieve this:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Drawing.Imaging;\nusing System.Text;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static async Task Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        string videoId = \"YOUR_VIDEO_ID\"; // Replace with your YouTube video ID\n        string base64Thumbnail = await GetYouTubeThumbnailAsBase64Async(videoId);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Base64 Thumbnail: \" + base64Thumbnail);\n    }\n\n    public static async Task<string> GetYouTubeThumbnailAsBase64Async(string videoId)\n    {\n        string thumbnailUrl = $\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/{videoId}/maxresdefault.jpg\";\n        \n        using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\n        byte[] imageBytes = await client.GetByteArrayAsync(thumbnailUrl);\n\n        return Convert.ToBase64String(imageBytes);\n    }\n}\n```\nReplace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual video ID you want to fetch the thumbnail for. The code above will print the Base64 encoded thumbnail image to the console.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet assumes that the thumbnail image is available in the `maxresdefault.jpg` resolution. In some cases, you might need to use a different resolution like `0.jpg`, `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, `3.jpg`, or `hqdefault.jpg`."

Make sure that Minikube is running and that the `minikube ip` command returns the correct IP address for the cluster.\n2. Make sure that the service or application that you are trying to access is running and listening on port 5000 within the Minikube cluster.\n3. Check the firewall rules on the host machine and the Minikube cluster to ensure that traffic on port 5000 is allowed.\n4. If you are using `socat` within a Docker container, make sure that you are using the `--network=host` flag to allow the container to access the host's network.\n\nI hope this helps!

If `Abilities.count` is 1, the code will print a string that contains `Ability1` in square brackets. If `Abilities.count` is 2, the code will print two strings, each containing one of `Ability1` and `Ability2` in square brackets.

If `Abilities.count` is 4, the code will print two strings as before, each containing `Ability1` and `Ability2` in square brackets.\n\nThe `default` case of the `switch` statement can't be reached, as the `switch` statement only handles the values 1, 2, 3, and 4.

It's generally a good idea to use descriptive and meaningful variable names, rather than short and ambiguous names like `Ability1`, `Ability2`, etc. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n2. The code uses `System.out.println` to print strings to the console. This is fine, but it might be more flexible and reusable to define a separate method that takes a list of strings as input and prints them in the desired format. This way, the `fightMenu` method could be used to print other types of menus as well.\n3. The code uses a `switch` statement to handle different cases based on the value of `Abilities.count`. This is fine, but it can be more efficient and less error-prone to use an `if` statement instead, especially if there are only a few possible values for `Abilities.count`.\n\nHere is an example of how the code could be rewritten using an `if` statement:\n```\npublic void fightMenu() {\n    if (Abilities.count == 1) {\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s]\", Ability1));\n    } else if (Abilities.count == 2) {\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s] [%s]\", Ability1, Ability2));\n    } else if (Abilities.count == 3) {\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s] [%s]\", Ability1, Ability2));\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s]\", Ability3));\n    } else if (Abilities.count == 4) {\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s] [%s]\", Ability1, Ability2));\n        System.out.println(String.format(\"[%s] [%s]\", Ability1, Ability2));\n    } else {\n        // Handle other values of Abilities.count\n    }\n}\n```\nThis version of the code uses an `if` statement to handle each of the possible values of `Abilities.count` separately. It also includes an `else` clause to handle any other values that `Abilities.count` might have.\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to rewrite the code. There are many other ways that the code could be improved or refactored, depending on your specific needs and goals."

Here is an example of how you could write an abstract method that takes a list of strings and prints them in the desired format:\n```\npublic abstract class MenuPrinter {\n    public abstract void printMenu(List<String> menuItems);\n}\n```\nThis `MenuPrinter` class defines an abstract `printMenu` method that takes a list of strings and prints them in some way. The details of how the menu is printed are left up to concrete implementations of the `MenuPrinter` class.\n\nTo use this `MenuPrinter` class, you would define a concrete implementation of the `printMenu` method for the type of menu that you want to print. For example, you could define a `FightMenuPrinter` class that prints a menu of fighting abilities:\n```\npublic class FightMenuPrinter extends MenuPrinter {\n    public void printMenu(List<String> menuItems) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < menuItems.size(); i++) {\n            String item = menuItems.get(i);\n            System.out.println(String.format(\"[%d] %s\", i + 1, item));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis `FightMenuPrinter` class defines a concrete implementation of the `printMenu` method that prints each menu item as a numbered list, with the item's index in square brackets and the item's name following it.\n\nTo use the `FightMenuPrinter` class, you can create an instance of it and call the `printMenu` method, passing in a list of menu items:\n```\nFightMenuPrinter menuPrinter = new FightMenuPrinter();\n\nList<String> menuItems = Arrays.asList(\"Ability 1\", \"Ability 2\", \"Ability 3\");\nmenuPrinter.printMenu(menuItems);\n```\nThis would print the following output to the console:\n```\n[1] Ability 1\n[2] Ability 2\n[3] Ability 3\n```\nBy defining different concrete implementations of the `MenuPrinter` class, you can easily create different types of menus with different layouts and formatting."

Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\npublic class FightMenuPrinter extends MenuPrinter {\n    public void printMenu(List<String> menuItems) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < menuItems.size(); i += 2) {\n            String item1 = menuItems.get(i);\n            String item2 = i + 1 < menuItems.size() ? menuItems.get(i + 1) : \"\";\n            System.out.println(String.format(\"[%d] %s [%d] %s\", i + 1, item1, i + 2, item2));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis version of the `FightMenuPrinter` class iterates over the menu items in pairs, using the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the current index is even. If the index is even, it prints the current item and the next item on the same line. If the index is odd, it prints just the current item.\n\nFor example, if you call the `printMenu` method with the following list of menu items:\n```\nList<String> menuItems = Arrays.asList(\"Ability 1\", \"Ability 2\", \"Ability 3\", \"Ability 4\");\nmenuPrinter.printMenu(menuItems);\n```\nThe `FightMenuPrinter` class will print the following output:\n```\n[1] Ability 1 [2] Ability 2\n[3] Ability 3 [4] Ability 4\n```\nNote that this is just one possible way to modify the `FightMenuPrinter` class to print the menu items in the desired format. There are many other ways that you could achieve the same result, depending on your specific needs and goals."

Ansible: Ansible is an open-source configuration management and automation tool that can be used for IAC. It allows you to define your infrastructure as code and automate the deployment and management of your resources.\n3. AWS CloudFormation: AWS CloudFormation is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to use templates to define and deploy your infrastructure as code. It is natively integrated with other AWS services, making it a good option for managing infrastructure within the AWS ecosystem.\n4. Azure Resource Manager (ARM): ARM is a service offered by Microsoft Azure that allows you to define your infrastructure as code and manage it using templates. It is natively integrated with other Azure services and supports a wide range of resources.\n\nUltimately, the best IAC tool for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

Here's an example:\n```python\ndef say_hello(name=\"\"):\n    if name:\n        print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nIn this example, `name` is an optional parameter with a default value of an empty string. If `name` is not provided when calling the function, the default value is used. If `name` is provided, the function prints a personalized greeting.\n\nTo call the function without arguments, simply call it with empty parentheses:\n```python\nsay_hello()     # Output: Hello, World!\n```\nTo call the function with an argument, pass the argument inside the parentheses:\n```python\nsay_hello(\"Alice\")      # Output: Hello, Alice!\n```"

The basic syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:\n```python\nfor variable in sequence:\n    # execute this code for each item in the sequence\n```\nHere, `variable` is a new variable that takes on the value of each item in the `sequence` for each iteration of the loop. The code inside the loop is executed once for each item in the `sequence`. Here's an example:\n```python\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\nIn this example, the `fruits` list is iterated over using the `for` loop, and the variable `fruit` takes on the value of each item in the list for each iteration. The output is:\n```\napple\nbanana\ncherry\n```\n### While Loops\n\nA `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax of a `while` loop is as follows:\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    # execute this code as long as the condition is true\n```\nHere, `condition` is an expression that is evaluated to `True` or `False`. The code inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is `True`. Here's an example:\n```python\ni = 1\nwhile i <= 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\nIn this example, the `while` loop is used to print the numbers 1 to 5. The `condition` is `i <= 5`, which is `True` as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration using the `i += 1` statement. The output is:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\nIn general, `for` loops are used when you want to iterate over a sequence of known length, while `while` loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met."

The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1; if so, it returns `n` as the Fibonacci number for that index. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and adds the results to compute the Fibonacci number for index `n`.\n\nTo print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using this function, you can use a `for` loop:\n```python\nn = 10   # number of Fibonacci numbers to print\nfor i in range(n):\n    print(fibonacci_recursive(i))\n```\nIn this example, `n` is set to 10, so the first 10 Fibonacci numbers are printed. The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`, which are used as the indices for the Fibonacci numbers. The `print` function is called with the result of calling `fibonacci_recursive` with each index. The output is:\n```\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n34\n```"

The output is:\n```css\nMove disk 1 from A to C\nMove disk 2 from A to B\nMove disk 1 from C to B\nMove disk 3 from A to C\nMove disk 1 from B to A\nMove disk 2 from B to C\nMove disk 1 from A to C\n```\nThese are the steps required to move 3 disks from pole 'A' to pole 'C' following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem."

Private attributes and methods can only be accessed from within the class itself, not from outside the class.\n\nHere's an example of using encapsulation in a class:\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self.__balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.__balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount <= self.__balance:\n            self.__balance -= amount\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.__balance\n```\nIn this example, we define a `BankAccount` class with a private `__balance` attribute and public `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods modify the `__balance` attribute, while the `get_balance` method returns its value. Because `__balance` is private, it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n\n#### Polymorphism\n\nPolymorphism is the concept of using the same interface (e.g., method name) to represent different types of objects. In Python, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and duck typing.\n\nHere's an example of using polymorphism in a class:\n```python\nclass Shape:\n    def area(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Rectangle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n\n    def area(self):\n        return self.width * self.height\n\nclass Circle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n    def area(self):\n        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Shape` parent class with an `area` method that raises a `NotImplementedError` exception (since the method should be overridden in child classes). We then define two child classes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`) that inherit from `Shape` and override the `area` method to compute the area of their respective shapes. We can then create objects of both classes and call their `area` methods, even though they have different implementations.\n\n#### Operator Overloading\n\nOperator overloading is the concept of defining special methods in a class to define how the class should behave with built-in Python operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). In Python, operator overloading is achieved by defining methods with special names that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__div__`).\n\nHere's an example of using operator overloading in a class:\n```python\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)\n\n    def __mul__(self, scalar):\n        return Vector(self.x * scalar, self.y * scalar)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Vector` class with `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__str__` methods. The `__add__` and"

        "value": "To call a class in Python, you need to first create an object of the class by calling its constructor method. Here's an example:\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def greet(self):\n        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old\")\n\n# Create an object of the Person class\nperson1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n\n# Call the greet method on the object\nperson1.greet()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Person` class with an `__init__` method that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes, as well as a `greet` method that prints a message introducing the person. We then create an object of the `Person` class by calling the constructor method (`Person(\"Alice\", 25)`), and store it in the variable `person1`. Finally, we call the `greet` method on `person1` by typing `person1.greet()`. This will print the message \"Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old\"."

Create a custom filter for `WalkForward`:\n```python\nclass WalkForwardFilter(admin.SimpleListFilter):\n    title = 'walkforward'\n    parameter_name = 'walkforward'\n\n    def lookups(self, request, model_admin):\n        walkforwards = WalkForward.objects.all()\n        return [(walkforward.pk, str(walkforward)) for walkforward in walkforwards]\n\n    def queryset(self, request, queryset):\n        if self.value():\n            return queryset.filter(fitted_model__walkforwards__pk=self.value())\n        return queryset\n```\n1.

Some argue that art is fundamentally a human endeavor that requires creativity, imagination, and emotional depth, and that AI-generated works lack these essential qualities. Others argue that AI-generated art is just as valid as any other form of art, and that the creative potential of AI can open up new avenues for artistic expression.\n\nOne argument in favor of AI-generated art is that it can challenge our assumptions about what constitutes creativity and artistic expression, and can expand our understanding of what is possible in the artistic realm. By using algorithms and machine learning to generate new and innovative forms of art, AI can push the boundaries of traditional art forms and create new hybrid forms that blur the lines between different disciplines.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics argue that AI-generated art lacks the emotional depth and human insight that is necessary for truly meaningful artistic expression, and that the creative decisions made by AI are ultimately determined by the algorithms and data sets that are used to program it. They also raise concerns about the impact of AI on traditional art forms and the role of human artists in the creative process.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether AI-generated art constitutes art is a matter of ongoing debate and discussion, and is likely to continue to evolve as technology and the art world continue to intersect."

These patterns and features are then used to generate new outputs that are similar to the original inputs, but also contain some degree of novelty or creativity.\n\nOne common approach to generating AI art is through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), which involve two neural networks working in opposition to each other. One network generates new images or other creative outputs, while the other network evaluates the quality of these outputs and provides feedback to the first network. Over time, the first network becomes better at generating high-quality outputs that satisfy the criteria set by the second network.\n\nAnother approach to generating AI art is through the use of style transfer algorithms, which involve taking a source image or other input and applying the style of another image or input to it. This can result in striking and often unexpected combinations of styles and themes, and can be used to create new and interesting forms of art.\n\nIn terms of how AI-generated art is produced, it can involve a variety of techniques, including the recombination of existing images or other creative works, the generation of new images based on mathematical patterns or algorithms, or a combination of both. Some AI algorithms are also able to take user input in the form of descriptive text or other inputs, and use this to generate new and unique forms of art.\n\nOverall, the process of generating AI art is a complex and multifaceted one, and can involve a wide range of algorithms, techniques, and approaches depending on the desired output and the specific tools and technologies being used."

        "value": "The use of AI algorithms to generate art that is based on or inspired by existing works of art raises important questions about copyright infringement and intellectual property rights. If an AI algorithm is trained on a dataset of existing art that includes works created by human artists, there may be concerns about whether the resulting AI-generated works constitute a form of copyright infringement.\n\nSome human artists may argue that their intellectual property rights are being violated if an AI algorithm is able to generate works that are highly similar to their own, or if an AI-generated work incorporates significant elements of their original work without permission. These concerns could be particularly acute if the AI-generated works are being sold or distributed for profit, or if they are being presented in a way that suggests they are original creations rather than derivative works.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that the use of AI algorithms to generate new and innovative forms of art is a form of fair use that is protected under copyright law. They point out that the algorithms used to generate AI art are often highly complex and incorporate many different inputs and sources of data, and that the resulting output is therefore highly original and transformative.\n\nOverall, the question of whether AI-generated art that is based on or inspired by existing works of art constitutes copyright infringement is a complex one, and is likely to be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion as AI and other forms of digital technology continue to transform the art world."

        "value": "There are several positive use cases for the use of AI in art education in a college setting, including:\n\n1. Enhanced art history research: AI algorithms can be used to analyze large volumes of art historical data and identify patterns and themes that may not be immediately apparent to human researchers. This can provide students with new insights into the history and development of different art movements and styles, and can help them to develop a deeper understanding of the context in which different works of art were created.\n2. Improved creative output: AI algorithms can also be used to help students improve their creative output and develop new ideas. For example, students can use AI-generated images or other creative inputs as a starting point for their own work, or they can use AI algorithms to generate new and innovative patterns and designs.\n3. Streamlined production processes: AI algorithms can be used to automate certain aspects of the creative process, such as image enhancement or color correction, allowing students to focus on more complex and creative tasks. This can lead to more efficient production processes and can help students to produce higher-quality work in less time.\n4. Expanded opportunities for collaboration: AI algorithms can facilitate collaboration between students from different disciplines, such as art and computer science, allowing them to work together on projects that combine artistic creativity with technical innovation. This can lead to the development of new and innovative forms of art that push the boundaries of traditional art forms and open up new opportunities for creative expression.\n5. Increased access to diverse perspectives: AI algorithms can be used to analyze diverse sets of data and generate new and unexpected insights into different cultures and artistic traditions. This can help students to develop a deeper understanding of the diverse perspectives that underpin different artistic movements and styles, and can broaden their appreciation of different forms of art."

        "value": "Yes, students can learn a great deal from AI art generators, including how to identify and recognize characteristics and styles of certain artists, movements, or periods.\n\nAI-generated art can be used as a tool for art historical research, allowing students to analyze and compare different works of art and identify patterns and themes that are characteristic of specific artists, movements, or periods. For example, AI algorithms can be used to analyze a large dataset of paintings from the Baroque period, identifying key stylistic features such as dramatic lighting, elaborate ornamentation, and dynamic compositions. This can help students to develop a deeper understanding of the key characteristics and themes of the Baroque style, and can provide a framework for analyzing and interpreting other works of art from this period.\n\nIn addition to its applications in art historical research, AI-generated art can also be used as a tool for creative inspiration and exploration. By exposing students to new and unconventional forms of art, AI-generated works can help to spark their creativity and encourage them to explore new artistic directions. For example, students can use AI-generated images or other creative inputs as a starting point for their own work, or they can use AI algorithms to generate new and innovative patterns and designs that draw inspiration from different artists, movements, or periods.\n\nOverall, AI-generated art can be a valuable tool for art education, helping students to develop their skills in art historical research, creative expression, and critical thinking, and enabling them to explore new and innovative forms of artistic practice."

It didn't help that my dad had to close down his retail stores in the city due to the pandemic. We created two new companies that year. Due to our financial situation, my family had decided to move to Texas from New York; this would be our fifth home since I was born. We understood what this called for, but packing and unpacking are still highly time-consuming, taking away from the limited time we had.\n\nMy side business of buying and selling sought-after sneakers using automation software was also taking off at the time, so I would manage that simultaneously. I did my best to focus in class, but I admit I often worked or packed while I should've been paying attention in class.\n\nMoving came with a whole new school where I couldn't choose my classes because I was enrolled late and wasn't even able to meet with my counselor due to covid restrictions. I juggled online classes and started new businesses back up with my dad. Covid-19 entirely shifted the way we lived from our environment and stress levels to our friends, or the lack thereof.\n\n--\n\nAdditional Info\n\nMany times during the last two years, I've sacrificed my focus on education to prioritize family. I've never concentrated less on school than in 2021, my junior year and a time when I was supposed to be applying for college. \n\nMy mother was expecting my baby brother. My grandparents had just come to live with us. My elder sister was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy as she had been diagnosed with lymphoma in March of 2021. My dad had been searching for work and found a restaurant space he would start leasing the same month of my sister's diagnosis. As the old saying goes, when it rains, it pours. \n\nMy typical day would consist of taking online classes while replying to customers of my e-commerce business and designing content or adjusting the website for my dad's restaurant. During the lunch break, I would pack orders, prepare them to ship out, and then have my actual lunch during my next class. After classes ended around 4:30, I'd go to the hospital to check up on my sister before rushing back home to get ready to work at the restaurant until eleven at night. My grandfather, who has Parkinson's and suffers from dementia, routinely forgets where he is and runs out of the house. Since my mom could not run after him, every few days, we'd have to come back early and try to find him walking through an empty street at night. \n\nObviously, this schedule left no time for studying and sometimes not even for homework. I remember staying up until 1 or 2 am after getting back to finish AP US History assignments. Since it was so impossible to retain information in class, I'd decided not to take the SAT and even skip one of three of my AP tests. I worked late nights the entire month of May, and the one day I missed work because I had an AP test in the morning was a disaster at the restaurant. \n\nSince I was little, I've been a straight A's, school-first student. Unfortunately, it became challenging to keep up with this mindset, but I'm happy that I learned through the obstacles and, as a result, became a more rigid and more well-rounded individual. \n\n--\n\nSMU Application:\nSMU appeals to students for a variety of reasons. Briefly describe why you are interested in attending SMU and what specific factors have led you to apply. (250-word limit)\\*\n\nSMU defines my intersection of interests and morals. \n \nOne aspect that stands out is that the Cox School of Business teachers have real-world experience in the industry. An opportunity to pick their brains and bounce ideas off my professors would greatly benefit me; experience stands as the best teacher. The University also puts an emphasis on diversity and pledges that \"Every Mustang Will Be Valued.\" Playing into that, the SMU Muslim Student Association has made efforts in raising charity for local refugees, something I can easily contribute to, given my background in the field. \n \nIt's also easy to start a new student organization not already present on campus. One of my first goals would be to create a blockchain club to explore the future of the Web3 movement with my peers. The Mustangs have also partnered with the NFTU program, showing the University is open to blockchain technology. A growth environment is\n\nMy sister, who attends Boston College, recommends finding a school with a college culture I'll remember. With SMU, I get the best of both worlds, a distinct, social culture while staying close to home. Recently, I met a professor at SMU at a community service event I took part in. She encouraged me to apply and check out the campus. When I visited, there was a college football game that night, and I got to see the enthusiasm in the community—a sense of livelihood I have missed since moving from New York. \nSMU is a diverse learning environment shaped by the convergence of ideas and cultures. How will your unique experiences or background enhance the University, and how will you benefit from this community? (250-word limit)\\*\nI bring my passions, culture, and experiences to SMU. Sharing my journey with those around me and hearing theirs. Engaging in deep conversations about culture, religion, and ethics is nothing new to me and serves as an example to learn from. \n \nThe best way to gain wisdom is from people and the environment. Being a Pakistani who comes from a background valuing family above all, I've gotten the chance to learn from the extraordinary journeys of the many who've made the voyage to America. These are my favorite stories to hear, some came to the country with little money, and even less formal education yet were successful in their endeavors through hard work and determination. \n \nAn advantage I think about frequently is the exposure to various personalities as a teenager in the city of New York. Absorbing diverse concepts and ideals serves as a leg up on the majority that hasn't. Our backgrounds mold us into who we are. Moving five houses in less than 15 years doesn't sound ideal, but it made me who I am today, and looking back, I'm thankful for the situation it has put me in. \n \nI aim to continue discovering new personalities at SMU. There are numerous stories of people finding a founding team for their business by networking at their University. I'm hoping to accomplish the same, surrounding myself with people who can teach me concepts I'm unfamiliar with and vice-versa. Ideas build on each other, and that's how we change the world.\n--\nDMHP: Write a letter to your future self:\n\nHello Zuhair,\n\nI'm writing this letter in 2022, just a day before our 18th birthday. Just two days ago, I attended Converge22 in San Francisco with Spawn, and I'm now trying to catch up on all the work I missed while I was away. My current stresses will probably seem minor to you now, but I need to figure out how to do my Calculus homework by tomorrow, and my group for the Comets to the Core presentation didn't even start on our slides yet.\n\nIn my list of long-term goals, I have two specific ones that I'm currently working on. The first is to start working out regularly, and the second is to learn how to code. For the last two weeks, I have been waking up around 6:30 to go to the gym, and my days have been feeling a lot more productive. At Converge, many people I met recommended I pick up a coding language as a technical skill to back up my design expertise and my interest in technology. I'm trying to learn javascript, and hopefully, by the time you're reading this, I'm familiar with multiple programming languages. I think it would be a huge unlock for me to add to my knowledge and build upon, mainly because I've been experimenting with programs since a young age.\n\nYou have a lot on your hands right now, namely, doing marketing for Spawn and now the UTD Investments Club. E-commerce is also doing reasonably well, but, especially in the holiday season, I just don't have enough hours in the day to concentrate on everything at total capacity. This week I've had to be on so many zoom calls while we put in proposals for sponsorships at Spawn.\n\nAnyway, I hope all is well. Whatever you do, take care of your health and spend time with family.\n\nWishing you the best - Zuhair, 2022\nTell us about a community or group to which you belong. How have you contributed to this group, and how has it benefitted you?\n\nI owe a lot of my accomplishments to my community, without which I wouldn't merely be the person I am today. Back in New York, my family played a significant role in MANA (Memon Association of North America); this group of Memons --a minority Muslim ethnic group originating from Indian and Pakistani heritage. MANA aimed to remind community members of their South Asian roots and keep a close-knit group of familiar faces.\n\nFor my parents, when they first moved, these were the only people they interacted with outside of work. In a place like New York, it's easy to get lost in fast-paced city life and forget where you come from. Memons are known for being merchants back in South Asia, so naturally, many community members also used the gatherings to network and help each other with the business and find partners for their children. \n\nEveryone starts somewhere, and for graphic design, MANA was looking for someone to design a flyer for a sports event. My dad told me I should do it, but I had no idea where to begin. I used web-based software and would screenshot the result. Looking back now, using several different fonts and colors is not as artistic as it seemed back then, but every time I look back, I see progress. \n\nMANA got me started with graphic design, and I still use the skills I first learned today; I went from picking random website templates to making my own using Adobe Illustrator and now Figma. Just this week, I am wrapping up two freelance projects for restaurants that hired me to design their logo, menu, and promotional content, and it all started by volunteering to make a cricket event graphic. My interest in design has even brought me to web design and app design, I've started experimenting with UI, and I trust I'll make the journey just like I did with flyer design. \n\nI continue to make flyers for MANA even after moving to Dallas. I owe them everything I've achieved in the design space and even business-wise. I've met my best friends by going to the event and still talk to them over discord, we're all similar in our business-mindedness, and there's no doubt the community helped shape that.\n--\nWhether it is graphic design, business ideas, or even thinking up games to play with my cousins, I have always found ways to incorporate my concepts to improve what I'm doing. I have been writing theories in a book since I was 12 years old, including developing electric cars and blockchain technology to stop corrupt government practices. Sometimes I will take breaks just to imagine the future of our existence, our roadblocks, and our objectives for a better life. In doing so, I idealize business paths for my future that solve said problems using technology. Automation has also been a focal point for me as I am interested in problem-solving and keep an open mind to upcoming innovations.\n\nI started in graphic design in 2016, and it has taken a significant portion of my time over the years. I visualize my ideas through digital work and incorporate my business sense to market products. I've learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro X, and Figma, all for this purpose. Today I have designed branding language for several successful companies and continue to use digital media to my strength. My campaigns tend to go outside of the box, resulting in higher click rates due to the creative nature of the advertisements.\n\n\nThey say, \"Curiosity killed the cat,\" but most don't know the end of the idiom: \"and satisfaction brought it back.\" Satisfaction eluding to the reward that one feels once they finally find the answer they were looking for. My curiosity works similarly, sometimes not allowing me to finish my work until I have found what I am searching for, even if it may seem irrelevant at the time. I often fight with myself for needing to know how everything works; However, the pleasure it brings once I figure it out has me outweighing the cost with the benefits. \n\nThe aspect of curiosity plays into my perfectionist persona. Everything must be top-notch, or I am left with the guilt of knowing I could have done better given a bit more time down the eternal rabbit hole. The price of curiosity does not come without its compensation, though; I believe if there is interest in a subject long enough, one will eventually become a beneficiary after investing their time and/or knowledge into a concept. \n\nMy curiosity ranges a broad spectrum with a passion for blockchain technology, efficient marketing strategy, and human psychology, to name a few. Given a chance, I will always investigate and ask questions about a field or idea that piques my interest, and once I start, there is no end in sight. Therefore the \"satisfaction\" is produced when I reach a milestone in the long journey.\n\nSelf-motivation is a concept most struggle with, though I think this is the most effective type of motive. This determination has brought itself to light in my life in various ways. Tying into the endless curiosity point, my character does not rest until I believe I have achieved the highest quality given my resources. There is always somewhere I can improve. No matter how hard I've worked, if the next day was not better than the last, then I am still failing. \n\nWhile I know it is impossible to reach perfection, this does not stop me from trying. I have an infinite amount of problems to solve and concepts to learn with less time every day, so I know if I stop pushing boundaries, they will push me.\n\nResiliency has played a factor in my school life where an 'A' could always become an 'A+,' and my presentations would take hours because the design and transitions had to be flawless. In business, I set goals for myself at 15 years old, much higher than I expected, only to hit them in a few months. A big part of that comes from the nature of my family; we've seen ups and downs, making us immune to the worst of times and cautious at the height. My mother always says, \"compare yourself only to who you were yesterday,\" meaning if I am not improving every day, I am falling behind. \n\nAt Syosset High School: \nDuring my time at Syosset High School, I could not become an officer of a club because of grade requirements. However, I did help out in the Investment club by raising funds after school, selling pizza. In the Entrepreneurship club, by getting four of my friends to join the club where we would meet with successful business people. \n\nAt Independence High School:\nWhile my time in-person at the school has been short, I have already reached out and met with the board of the National Honors Society board and am helping them create and logo for this year's merchandise using my graphic design knowledge. I enjoy this type of work as it helps me gain experience while also helping the community.\n\nElaborate on what you would like the college admission committee to know about you regarding personal qualities, unusual talents, academic strengths, community activities, etc\n\nMy university should know my story, the building blocks to who I am today. Having moved five homes, I have gotten a diverse look into the lives of others. Due to this, I can easily empathize with the challenges people face. In addition, I problem solve quicker than most after being exposed to multiple ways of doing a task. While a nomadic life may look stressful to most, it plays an advantage in developing my social consciousness. \n\nThe exposure has allowed me to contribute to community efforts, such as creating a fundraiser to supply food and essentials to those suffering in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. My friends and I arranged boxes and negotiated with retailers to provide cost-effective supplies to give out. We utilized Facebook to search for those who needed help most at the time—sometimes driving to Brooklyn, an hour drive from Long Island, just to deliver a box of food to a woman who just lost her job due to the circumstances. \n\nThen a monumental shift when my family moved to Dallas, but it was easy for me; I knew what had to be done and how to adapt. I was a pro at this point. Moving multiple times has allowed me to grasp a comprehensive view of the world and prepared me to adjust to my environment in the future. \n\nSome talents are genetic or even innate. Marketing represents this quality for me. It just seems right to me. Ever since I was young, I have been able to sell anything. At six years old, I traded my pokemon cards and snacks for what I thought was the better share of the deal. Today I run an e-commerce business selling electronics and apparel nationwide. It's just in my genes; it seems native. \nWhat do you consider to be your most important activity/(ies) outside of school? You may include jobs, religious activities, hobbies, and special talents. Why are these important to you? \n\nExperience came in many fields for me, mainly in the last two years of my life. In 2016 I volunteered to do graphic design and photography for a local community my family was involved in. Their goal was to involve more youth members using digital media. \n\nThe only problem was, I had no prior experience. I used web-based programs for the flyer designs, and I would use my sister's Nikon camera to shoot pictures for the photography. Later on, I'd go on to explore the depths of how I can use digital media.2 I learned photography, video editing, and some graphic design in just a couple of weeks. I was eager to learn, and designing seemed to come easily with my interest in tech. \n\nLittle did I know this volunteering changed everything for me. It took years to grasp some design and video editing concepts, many of which I don't even know today, but most beneficial was the start. A few years later, I was hired for some baking company to make Instagram posts. I would charge $20 for each. Looking back at it, I realize my prices were extremely low for the quality of work. \n\nDuring the same time, my friend had told me about the profitable business of reselling sneakers. I tried that and started using my graphic design experience to create high-ranking eBay listings for what I was selling. I didn't think much of it for some time...\n\nThen the world was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic. I started to help my dad shift his business because his sole source of income, physical cell phone stores, had to be shut down due to the state mandate. My dad and I would build a wholesale brand in March of 2020 to make an income. I would also explore resale opportunities on the side, separately, that I would start saving up and investing in. From some birthday money I was saving up for three years, I had managed to buy shoes, toys, and other limited, high-profit items. \n\nWhen we moved to Texas, I had some capital left after liquidating my small stock in New York. I made choices based on what we learned in class, and I would buy popular children's toys and games to prepare for the holiday season when supply would be low, but demand would skyrocket. The market was low on stock due to shipping difficulties regarding the pandemic, increasing the already high holiday premiums leading to my first 1,000 orders, all while attending virtual classes from my laptop. I would write my essays early in the morning to have enough time to package shipments for the afternoon. \n\n\nWhich high school teacher/class has impacted you most, and why/how?\n\nIn 10th grade, I took a College Marketing Class; this would be my first College Level course, earning me six credits by the end of the school year. The class would serve my interests and introduce new strategies to me. \n\nThrough the course, I gained the opportunity to be selected for a marketing and design competition—a perfect blend of my skills. We were posed with creating a logo and rebranding strategy for an old Italian restaurant looking to open itself up to a younger crowd. Using my graphic design experience and my newly found marketing strategies, I worked a month on the poster board and elements to present. I would stay after school and come early to create what I thought was my best work at the time. \n\nI ended up getting 2nd place out of the 32 contestants that day. The only weakness in my display was my presenting skills; I had focused too much on the graphics and board aesthetics that I forgot to review the delivery. I'd be super observant in class for the rest of the course to up my presentation ability. I felt so defeated that I watched hours of presenters on YouTube for the next few months. I've watched TED Talks on every topic. Today, I am a confident presenter and can establish my presence acting as a magnet to watch and absorb.\n\nIn what ways are you more prepared to live independently than you were two years ago?\n\nFor most of last year, I already felt I was living independently. My sister was home from Boston College after getting diagnosed with Leukemia. My mother was expecting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my dad would search for work, and my little sister would be in school until 3:30. With my virtual classes in session, I would be responsible for making my meals and making enough for my mom and sisters. I realized afterward that the experience helped a lot with my time management skills, even experimenting by getting up earlier to give myself a head start on the day. I downloaded the Walmart+ app, so instead of going to the grocery store when my mom wasn't feeling well, we could just order groceries digitally, saving a lot of time and energy.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in the future? What are your post-graduate plans?\n\nHave you ever heard of the 'Zone of Genius'? Gay Hendricks wrote about the concept in his book The Big Leap. Simply put, it is the point where all your skills and your 'innate genius' meet. The zone is what is most seems most effortless for you and difficult for the majority. To bring it to its potential, we must practice our natural talent and blend it with our passions. For me, that is Graphic Design and Marketing paired with my interest in blockchain technology. Along with some friends, I have already started building a project utilizing the technology, and I have so many ideas on how to implement it into everyone's daily life. \n\nBlockchain is my future because it is ultimately humanity's future. The technology is our only hope to introduce a transparent commerce system when the people in power prefer to hide their shady dealings. It solves the problem of corruption and resolves some of the power of giant corporations. Blockchain technology can't be stopped, and nor can I.\n\nThe only thing I know for certain is that blockchain will be involved in my future; the rest is flexible. Given the adaptable nature I eluded earlier, I am willing to go where life takes me. \n\nWhat other information would be helpful for your counselor to know? Difficulties overcome, struggles, mitigating circumstances, passions... Be sure to mention if you moved to our school during HS, if you have a disability, or if anything else has impacted your GPA. \n\nMy GPA would look better if I did not engage in multiple out-of-school activities last year. I would work on my e-commerce business for a significant portion of the day, leaving less time for school work and studying. The only day I took off was the day of my AP test. Had I portioned the time out for studying instead of working, I would see the results in my favor. However, I decided on my future as I believe the experience I gained combats a few percentage points. \n\nThe same goes for my SAT, I probably should have studied when I was working, but I did not. I took my first SAT this year with no PSAT before. Decisions were made; I can't tell if they were good ones until the future.\n\nAs for my Freshman and Sophomore grades, I am pretty satisfied knowing the rigorous courses offered there. I never missed honor roll any quarter, and knowing how competitive the school was, it felt like an outstanding achievement. The classes were challenging, and I knew no one with a perfect GPA there. \n\nHowever, I learned that Frisco School District often allows retests on every exam until a student reaches 100% and uses other tactics such as 'waterfalling' to ensure no student fails. Therefore my GPA will be lower than most of the others because my former school did not allow such practices. Although this is the case, I won't let it worry me as it will push me harder to come out on top."

My mom texts me, asking why I have yet to come home, I let her know my dad needed me at work, and I'm still stressing about how the employees will manage without me. The thought of another bad review on Facebook haunts me as I enter the door. Thoughts swirl, but I know I can't show my concern outwardly.\n\nMy mom is seven months pregnant with my baby brother, our entire family is preoccupied with my sister's cancer diagnosis, and the same month her treatment starts, my dad's restaurant opens. Not to mention, it was also Ramadan, meaning for us Muslims, we had to fast each day of the month. We didn't even have a source of income. Outside of family, there is no one we can rely on.

You may also want to explain unique aspects of your academic background or valued experiences you may have had that relate to your academic discipline. The statement of purpose is not meant to be a listing of accomplishments in high school or a record of your participation in school-related activities. Rather, this is your opportunity to address the admissions committee directly and to let us know more about you as an individual, in a manner that your transcripts and other application information cannot convey. \n\nAlthough the prompt is lengthy, UT-Austin reviewers are looking for you to address directly a few things, more or less in this order: \n\nYour previous academic experiences and development \n\nYour current studies \n\nYour future academic and professional goals\n\nHow a UT education can help you achieve them\n\nAny special or extenuating circumstances.\n\nI provide a series of blog posts offering tips starting here.\n\nThroughout, you should provide specific examples why you are deserving of a space on campus and in your major and what perspectives you bring to the university.\n\nBelow, I provide five different approaches to addressing this question. Each of these applicants gained admission.\n\nInterested in working together? Complete my questionnaire for a free e-mail consultation.\n\nAdmitted McCombs School of Business Transfer 3.8 GPA\nI stood still, lost amidst a sea of towering figures. I felt the familiarity of being alone. Each time I change environments, it doesn’t come any easier. A broad-shouldered girl in a blue shirt asked accusingly me where I needed to be. Despite intimidating me at first, she turned out to be sweet and concerned for my well-being. \n\nShe took me to my classroom and introduced me to the other girls. They all seemed so different from me. My family left the United States when I was young, and during my ten years spent in India, I switched between three very different schools.\n\nAccustomed to American schools that are relatively orderly and organized, it took time to adjust to India’s disorderly schools. Just as I started feeling comfortable with the unusual teaching methods of my new school, my parents transferred me to a more “cultural” school. With a total of seven students in the entire school, we learned in literal shacks. \n\nMy classmates were behind in their education and far below my grade level, so the teachers focused most of their time on them. I suffered greatly when I switched back into mainstream schooling. Now, it was my classmates who raced through their work. I was thrown, unprepared, into India’s rigorous education system. I struggled with constructing angles and balancing chemical equations. I had to work especially hard to make up for the time lost at my cultural school. \n\nI made it through Tenth grade with extensive additional coaching. Despite my setback, I knew that I could do better. Through my classes, I began to develop an interest with the mathematical functions that power finance and accounting. My accounting teacher became my biggest inspiration. The way she related accounting procedures to current business crises convinced me to learn more. I started keeping up with companies’ corporate strategies and their effect on the economy. \n\nBefore my board exams, I completed additional work on my own and solved about 70 papers in preparation. The work ethic I acquired under her guidance is something that has stuck to me through the challenging times at community college. I continue to self-study with online courses offered on Khan Academy to further exceed expectations.\n\nAdditionally, my internship at the Pratham International School in the summer of 2016 gave me real-world experience with auditing and organizing financials. I applied my classroom and self-studying knowledge to help with vendor payment methods and profitable tuition pricing. \n\nI also pursued an internship in the accounting department of The Home Depot. For the first time, I saw theoretical concepts come to life as I helped facilitate vendor payment methods and profitable product pricing. The chance to interact with higher level financial managers gave me exposure to strategic decision making and contingency planning. \n\nI look forward to pursuing another internship and taking advantage of the connections provided by the McCombs School of Business. I hope the university will help connect me with fruitful opportunities to develop my business competencies. By participating in the Texas Stock Team and The University Finance Association, I can explore different interests and develop my network. I don’t have these opportunities at Houston Community College, and I don’t think any Texas university offers the unparalleled opportunities of UT. Doing research under award winning professors like Laura Starks and Robert Parrino will give me a head start in the industry. \n\nLike The University of Texas, I also want to transform myself and change the world. The past few months at the Houston community college have helped me realize that I need an environment with a limitless ceiling for growth. Since I have experienced many different educational environments, I have a good idea for what I seek while avoiding opportunities that may not be in my best interest. I bring a different perspective that will contribute to classroom discussions and be a valued addition to the McCombs community.\n\nCommentary\nI clearly remember this student’s dramatic admissions decision. UT actually released almost all of their rejections and acceptances by early June, yet this applicant didn’t hear back until a week later. \n\nWe both assumed that wasn’t good news, but we were pleasantly surprised that they received a last minute acceptance into the McCombs School of Business. I have no doubt that their Essay A Statement of Purpose and resume tipped the scales in their favor despite their below average GPA.\n\nThey cover a lot of territory discussing being raised in two different countries and attending three different schools with radically different environments before transitioning back to Texas and attending HCC. They touch on independent studies and a relevant internship that informs their prospective major and career goals.\n\nThey also do a nice job of describing how their current college has a low ceiling and will not allow them to achieve their long-term goals. They’ve done their homework by supplying a few informative “Why UT” statements concerning student organizations and professors to help reviewers imagine how this student might contribute to the Forty Acres.\n\nThroughout, they argue convincingly that they know where they want to go, how they bring diverse perspectives to campus, and why UT is their best fit university.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nFour-Year Liberal Arts Admit 4.0 GPA\nMy decision to enroll at the University of North Texas was ill–informed. Initially, I believed that, far enough away from my family yet close enough to return home every few weeks, I could grow on my terms. This unfortunate decision was fostered by my perspective of academic environments and the “college life.” I believed a university education was something purely academic, never multifaceted. \n\nAs someone who has never considered myself particularly school–spirited, I did not feel the need to be connected to any larger community. I viewed my transition to college simply as a stepping stone to the next chapter of my life, a means to an end and not something inherently valuable. \n\nI chose UNT by process of elimination. I wanted to attend a Texas public university, but not as close as San Marcos and Austin or even College Station or Houston. However, the more time I spent in Denton, the more I realized that there was a low ceiling for my potential to grow. I felt like a “big fish in a small pond” and my development, both intellectual and social, stalled. \n\nI have always aspired to something greater, something more challenging, something different. These aspirations, unfortunately, were not able to be experienced at UNT. My courses were stagnant, easy, “go with the flow”––the exact opposite of what I needed. Most students around me, even those within the Honors College, did not study for major exams or complete their assignments on time. It made me restless and uneasy. \n\nAs time wore on, I concluded I was not finding the challenges I originally sought. I refused to settle into the mediocre routines around me and merely coast along with strong, yet hollow grades. The more I considered and explored my academic goals and future, the clearer it became that only the University of Texas offers the rigor and challenge that I seek. \n\nThis fall, I visited the 40 Acres and immediately noticed a striking difference. Nearly every other student I came across wore burnt orange; people walked confidently and actually socialized on campus. There seemed to be a school spirit that was conspicuously absent at UNT. The University of Texas felt like a family, a cohesive yet still fiercely individualistic unit. Even with a just a two–hour visit to the 40 Acres, I could already feel its infectious energy creeping up inside me, a feeling I would not soon forget.\n\nI had not considered that a university experience could be both academically enriching and spiritually fulfilling. Instantly, I knew where I needed to call home. My fascination and excitement was furthered with the University of Texas when I researched the Anthropology Department. I was amazed at the never–ending opportunities for research. For example, Dr. Courtney Handman’s focus on linguistic anthropology and her examination of recently–converted Protestant indigenous communities in rural Papua New Guinea related to my interests of languages, religion, and their convergence.\n\nMy passion with linguistic anthropology began when I was nine years old when my parents took me on my first international trip. We traveled throughout Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Sicilia, and Croatia. With each country, there was an entire new method of communication, an entirely new way of life. \n\nExposure to different cultures and languages, however, was not an entirely new concept. I live in a bilingual home. My father grew up in Madrid and learned both Spanish and English. My father wanted to share a vital part of his identity and childhood with me, and we communicate primarily in Spanish. Later, I became unsatisfied with only speaking two languages, and self–studied French. \n\nBy the time I entered high school, I could converse fluently with both my French and Spanish teachers. These experiences continue to shape and inform my desire to balance the arts and sciences by studying linguistic anthropology before enrolling in medical school. \n\nCommentary\nSince they are applying to a non-STEM program with a 4.0, it isn’t necessary for this applicant to discuss their grades or relevant coursework. Despite having a high chance of gaining admission based on their grades, they leave little room for doubt by submitting a thoughtful essay that describes honestly their decision to attend UNT and why that isn’t working out.\n\nIt’s a balanced essay that focuses equally on where they’re coming from and how UT can help them explore their interests and achieve their long-term goals. Any time a transfer applicant is coming from a four-year university, its important to discuss tastefully why they don’t feel their current university is a good fit. We worked for a while on striking the right tone.\n\nTo discuss why UT is a great fit and why you want to transfer often requires developing why you’re currently dissatisfied. Their reviewer can no doubt relate to their story of not knowing what they want as a high school student and how attending college gives them an idea of what they don’t prefer moving forward.\n\nUT has extensive study abroad and language programs, and they develop well how UT offers resources not accessible at any other public university. They demonstrate how their current studies and travels abroad inform them that although they want to change universities, they want to continue majoring in Anthropology.\n\nInterested in working together?

It took three minutes to arrive at the base of the towering skyscraper. I sighed, disappointed, and accepted this final defeat to cap a dispiriting senior year as I nervously navigated through the downtown underground labyrinth.\n\nLike many of my classmates, I spent most of my high school years working tirelessly in hopes of attending a prestigious university. With each rejection letter, I wasn’t sure any university would admit me. Receiving CAP stung particularly. I questioned the point of studying so long for my SAT and ACT and taking a few AP courses that didn’t particularly interest me. Reluctantly, I submitted the deposit to my safety school. \n\nI walked to my car that day feeling like I've lost before I even started. Even getting to my interview proved frustrating. I had never visited downtown Houston. Battling traffic and tricky one-ways, I found the parking garage, slid into a space without bumping my neighbors and stumbled through the building before finding the first set of elevators, “Sky Lobby.” I boarded. A man in his forties joined followed quickly by a college-aged student. More men and women filed in until we crunched together shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nI felt out of place, and dad’s suit didn’t fit right - sleeves too long and shoulder pads jutting below my neck. Everyone appeared so confident. People talked over one another as they discussed seemingly important things like upcoming meetings and lunch plans. Noises blended, a hum of indistinct chatter. After three deafening minutes of chit-chat, a merciful ding signaled our arrival. The doors glided inwards.\n\nA nervous silence preceded a burst of sunlight. I stepped into the panoramic atrium offering a birds-eye view of Houston, the Sky Lobby. Despite living in Houston for my entire life, I could never have imagined the city so beautiful. I absorbed the scenes below – the bustling traffic, the diverging currents of the bayou snaking in the distance, and the impersonal skyscrapers dotting the vista, silently taunting our unrestricted zoning laws. I swear I could almost see the curvature of the Earth, two million people all in my field of view.\n\nA friendly voice interrupted my gaze. The secretary welcomed me into a grand office that may have passed for a museum. The next moments were a blank. A blurred, neurotic, sweaty blank. Slowly, I walked back to the elevator wide-eyed, almost bewildered. \n\nWhile planning my classes at university I never really hoped to attend, I heard a ding signaling the arrival of an email on my phone. “Probably some more spam,” I thought. The title betrayed great news, “Congratulations.”\n\nIn his concluding remarks at a Dillard University commencement speech, the great Denzel Washington advised, “Don’t aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference.” These words now stick to me like glue. Looking back to when those elevator doors first opened, I believe it was at that moment, with the city at my fingertips, that I aspired to make a difference.\n\nBefore, I viewed education as a means to an end, a minor footnote in my transition to the professional world. After that day, I saw the bigger picture. A purposeful education produces change within and bettering the world around me. At Houston Endowment, I learned the ins and outs of the workings of a non-profit foundation. I even had the privilege of personally speaking one-on-one with non-profit executives around Houston. While my internship is generally reserved for students at the end of their college careers, I was able to gain exposure to community and business leaders that have shown me that thoughtful, long-term efforts can make the world a better place. \n\nFrom the first moment each Longhorn arrives on the 40 Acres, they receive the message that “What starts here changes the world.” What’s so brilliant about this motto is that it gives the beholder freedom to interpret their place at the university, their communities, and how their education produces ripples of change throughout the world. \n\nIt seems to me that to be a Longhorn means to be a leader. To be that which “changes the world.” I don’t feel a similar sense of purpose and community at UH, and feel the path to being leader lies in Austin. With the experiences I gained from my descent into Houston’s philanthropic heart, I intend to hone my dream to be the leader of change that UT trains all its students to be. \n\nCommentary\nI like this essay a lot because it shares a compelling story that frames where they’ve come from academically and professionally, where they currently are, and how UT can help them achieve their goals. They also discussed why they enrolled at the University of Houston, their home city, rather than pursuing UT-Austin’s Coordinated Admissions Program.\n\nThey have strong statements throughout that they’re deserving of a space in admissions. They discuss how they will bring a unique perspective to campus and how they seem themselves as a leader on the Forty Acres. They also touch on how their academic goals and beliefs have evolved over time, transitioning from “seeing education as a means to an end” to one where education is a value in itself.\n\nIt’s a well-written response that no doubt helped their reviewer form a mental image of the student. It solicits empathy. Everyone can relate to the nervousness of being out of their element and receiving pleasant surprising news when they were otherwise doubtful.\n\nDespite their below average GPA, there’s no doubt they gained admission on the strength of this Essay A that helped connect their expanded resume and Essay E about growing up in a mixed-religions household.\n\nInterested in building your best transfer application? Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation.\n\nMoody College of Communications Admitted Transfer 3.3 GPA \nI am currently enrolled as a first-year student at Collin College in Frisco, Texas, and I want to finish my studies at the University of Texas in Austin majoring in public relations.\n\nMy decision to attend Collin stemmed from my mediocre grades in high school – I wanted a fresh start at a college close to home. Though I was accepted at a few well-ranked Texas public universities, I had higher aspirations. I felt that I could improve my grade point average while completing prerequisite courses transferable anywhere. I lived at home allowing me to save money, help my family, and continue working at my job.\n\nDue to my family’s dire financial situation, I initially wanted to pursue a degree in business and finance solely to be more financially secure and allow me the opportunity to raise my own family someday. I took several business-related classes in high school and college. My goal has always been to transfer to UT and earn a degree in finance. \n\nIn preparation for transfer, I took Algebra, Pre-calculus, and Calculus 1 and 2. Math is not my strongest subject, and I found Pre-calculus and Calculus to be especially difficult. Despite joining a study group and meeting with the professor but, unfortunately, it wasn’t enough. My low math grades are not for lack of effort. \n\nAt the time, I was taking care of my mother, a single parent, and coordinating her transfer to rehab for alcohol addiction. I became the head of household responsible for caring for my three younger sisters. I became a full-time student, employee, and house mom. Instead of getting discouraged by my setback in calculus, I saw it as an opportunity to grow and reconsider my future. I realized that if math isn’t my strong suit, I probably won’t enjoy a career in banking. I feel like many of my friends want to go to business school, but don’t actually enjoy the work or have the skills required to be a successful student. I felt that my decision to pursue finance came not from my own motivations, but pressures from friends, family, and society. \n\nI considered my strengths, and now I understand that I love communicating with people and solving problems. I’m the go-to person in my friend group when relationships end or problems happen at school, and I am used to handling family crises at home. I want to help solve problems on behalf of companies, and I feel that public relations is my perfect fit.\n\nI learned to communicate effectively at an early age. No matter what situation my family was going through, my sisters and other relatives considered my opinions and often put my suggestions into practice. My survival and quality of life depends on resolving conflicts for work, for my internship, and for relaying messages within a divided family. Recognizing my strength, I feel that public relations would be the perfect major for me. \n\nTo gain firsthand experience and test my decision, I took on a Public Relations/Blogger Relations internship for Conscious Couture. Through reaching out to bloggers that have PR firms, I am reassured that I made the right decision and have truly found what I love. Also, I have previous professional experience as an executive assistant for Texas Family Fitness. I was constantly phoning clients, communicating with employees, setting up meetings, proposing new ideas, and managing conflict in the workplace. \n\nAfter doing research, I learned that UT has one of the best public relations departments and employs world-renowned faculty. I especially like the internship requirement and career placement resources. My goal is to begin with a major public relations firm and, ultimately, establish my own firm. If I decide to continue my studies after my bachelor’s, the LBJ School of Public Affairs seems like an appealing way to transition into government work. \n\nCommentary\nThis particular student had a 3.0 by the deadline, and since they had less than 24 hours completed, UT waited to make their decision after receiving their spring grades. They made a D in Calculus, so this essay helps put that grade into context.\n\nI appreciate that this essay is very straightforward. They get right to the point why they are at their current university, what they hope to study at UT, and how their goals evolved over time.\n\nOne pitfall of extenuating circumstances essays is they tend towards hyperbole and overexageration. This applicant provides balance and nuance to their issues at home and concrete ways that they’ve developed and matured over time. They also link their special circumstances into their proposed major, Public Relations.\n\nThey also develop well how their professional experiences and internship further influence their decision to transfer. Their Essay A complements and provides context to their expanded resume. They argue convincingly that UT is the best fit for them because of its strong academics while still being close enough to home to visit on the weekends.\n\nPutting their poor calculus grade into context, articulating but not going overboard about their special circumstances, and demonstrating their fit for major undoubtedly played a major role in them gaining admission to UT.\n\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\n\nOOS Moody College of Communications Admit 3.41 GPA\nIt was early in 2016 and I needed a job. Seton Hall – my current university – costs about $14,000 per semester just for tuition. Growing up with the potential to be the first in my family to attend college, I never took college enrollment for granted. I saw the financial burden my decision placed on my parents. I came across a job listing for a Human Resources Policy Management Resource for Johnson & Johnson. After a rigorous interview process, they offered me one of three openings among hundreds of college-educated applicants. It was a long shot since I don’t study business and I lack professional experience. My position was no mere internship; I began working in March as a full-time contractor. \n\nWith no awareness of the corporate world, I had to learn office politics, bureaucracy, and division of responsibilities on the fly. I updated human resources policies from Johnson & Johnson’s global business holdings and received approval from the policy owner and the legal department. Next, we worked with translators from 30+ languages to convert the documents into their language of origin. Finally, I uploaded the policies onto the HR Portal for the thousands of employees to see. \n\nI functioned as the liaison between policy owners and J&J, including those in non-English speaking countries, who were operating in different time zone. Working cross-culturally can be a challenge, but I learned quickly. I stayed organized and met intense deadlines assigned to my team by the Vice President of Global HR Services. I worked thirty to forty hours each week while taking a full course load. \n\nBefore my Johnson & Johnson contract expired, the Director of Human Resources, impressed with my work, suggested that I interview for another position. I received a job offer; however, Jeffery Vanderbeek, the former Vice President of the Lehman Brothers and former Chairman and Owner of the New Jersey Devils, called me. Nearing retirement, he recently accepted the football head coach position at Somerville High School near my hometown. Jeff heard about an online radio station I started for my alma matter Immaculata High School. He offered me a job on the spot to run the communications efforts for Somerville Football. I accepted with much excitement so I could continue pursuing my communications passion.\n\nI began by building a website and managing their nascent social media channels. I started producing a weekly documentary series following their progress during the season. I hired and managed two media interns. I divided responsibilities and maintained our daily schedule to keep our workflow moving smoothly. Some might write this off as merely doing work for a High School team, but I disagree. \n\nI answered every day to a man who occupied corner offices atop Wall Street skyscrapers and oversaw operating budgets in the tens of billions of dollars. He asked same of me as with his Lehman Brothers partners. While that could understandably be stressful, working for Johnson and Johnson prepared me for adapting to pressure and navigating powerful personalities. \n\nSomerville and Mr. Vanderbeek helped me become a team player and showcase the best side of their football team. Mr. Vanderbeek served as a mentor to me and everyday pushed me to achieve more. I am eternally grateful for his lessons on leadership and how, with ambition and hard work, I can also rise to the top to my future career, broadcasting.\n\nI visited UT in October and immediately felt at home. I sat impressed through a taping for Texas Student Television in the Moody College of Communications. I had been around video production for a number of years, but never had I seen such a group of talented professionals my age working so passionately. It really brought about much excitement within me and reignited the fire I have for the profession. The RTF program at UT is a world-class education with deep industry connections. It is where I need to be.\n\nCommentary\nLike the previous example, this straightforward essay addresses all of the things that UT reviewers are looking for. They discuss the context and buyer’s remorse about attending an expensive private university, but they don’t dwell on it. \n\nInstead, they focus on their strengths - pursuing a highly selective and well-paying internship and relevant social media/broadcasting examples. Since they had an influential mentor who also submitted a reference letter, their Essay A develops well their argument that they are prepared to succeed at UT-Austin.\n\nThey applied as an out-of-state student from New Jersey, so they also address in their last paragraph how UT can help them achieve their goals. Providing specific observations from their visit let’s the review know that they are making an informed decision to transfer.\n\nAlthough they changed their major from RTF to Journalism after arriving on campus, they secured a recent, highly prestigious internship at the CBS Morning Show in Manhattan. They are also involved with Texas Student Television, so there’s no doubt UT extending this student an offer pays dividends for the university. \n\nUT-Austin utilizes the transfer process to bring leaders onto campus who can introduce different perspectives to classroom discussions and student organizations."

Yet, despite the challenges and disruptions to my education, I have always been driven by curiosity and a desire to learn and improve.\n\nI consider myself very orderly, but I still need to prepare my things for the next day. My mom texts me, asking why I have yet to come home, and I let her know my dad needed me at work. The thought of another bad review on Facebook haunts me as I enter the door. Thoughts swirl, but I know I can't show my concern outwardly.\n\nThroughout high school, I never missed the honor roll; anything under a 90 was disappointing. Now juggling school and working most of the day, including during class, made my standards for myself nearly unrealistic. In times like these, a 5.0 rating on Google Maps means more than a 4.0 in my report card.\n\nDespite the challenges, I have always been driven to excel and make the most of my education. I joined The University of Texas at Dallas, and while I enjoy my time here, I owe it to myself to increase my potential and move to Austin. That's why I am applying to the McCombs School of Business as a Management Information Systems major at UT Austin.\n\nWhile I was at UT Dallas, I had the opportunity to work closely with Jake Levy, the founder of Spawn, a student-led startup aimed at connecting education with employment. Jake is a student at UT Austin, and it was through working with him that I became interested in transferring to UT Austin and pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems.\n\nI believe that UT Austin is the perfect fit for me because of its strong programs in business and technology, as well as its commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship. I am excited about the opportunity to be a part of a community of students and professors who are passionate about using their skills to make a difference in the world.\n\nI am confident that UT Austin will provide me with the education, experiences, and connections that I need to achieve my academic and professional goals. I am eager to contribute my skills, insights, and perspective to the UT Austin community, and to make the most of all that UT Austin has to offer.\n\nOverall, this essay is approximately 650 words and addresses the UT Austin prompt by discussing your academic background, your current studies, your future goals, and how a UT Austin education can help you achieve them. It also touches on your unique experiences, such as working with Jake Levy and Spawn, and your desire to contribute to the UT Austin community."

On top of all of this, it was also Ramadan, which meant that my family and I were fasting each day of the month.

Declaring a new abstract base class with the same name but with the keyword \"virtual\" before the function.\n2. Declaring the abstract functions with the \"= 0\" at the end of the function declaration\n3. Derive the Data class from the abstract base class\n\nFor example:\n```\nclass IData\n{\npublic:\n    virtual QPointF GetValue() const = 0;\n};\n\nclass Data : public QObject, public IData\n{\n    Q_OBJECT\n    Q_PROPERTY(QPointF GetValue READ GetValue NOTIFY sgnl_ValueChanged)\n\npublic:\n    Data(QObject* parent = Q_NULLPTR);\n    QPointF GetValue() const override { return m_Value; }\n\nprivate:\n    QTimer* m_Timer;\n    QPointF m_Value;\n\nsignals:\n    void sgnl_ValueChanged();\n\nprivate slots:\n    void slt_Timeout();\n};\n```\nBy doing this way, the class Data is now forced to implement the GetValue() function, and the IData class can be used as a common interface for any class that needs to implement the functionality of the GetValue() function."

The Data class has a slot update() function that is called whenever the value in the Updater class changes. This way the Data class can have the updated value without blocking the main thread.\nYou can also add a QTimer object to Updater class to periodically update the value instead of using while(true) loop."

You can use the `open()` method and the `send()` method of the `XMLHttpRequest` object or the `fetch()` function to make other types of requests (such as POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and to send data along with the request."

It uses two type operators: `typeof` and `keyof`.\n\nThe `typeof` operator gets the type of a value. In this case, it gets the type of the `EVENT_TYPES` object, which is `{ SCREEN_OPENING: \"opnscr\"; USER_ACTION: \"userac\"; BACKEND_EVENT: \"bckend\"; }`.\n\nThe `keyof` operator gets the keys of an object type or union type as a type. In this case, it gets the keys of the type of the `EVENT_TYPES` object, which are 'SCREEN\\_OPENING', 'USER\\_ACTION', and 'BACKEND\\_EVENT'.\n\nFinally, the `EventType` type is created by indexing into the `EVENT_TYPES` object with the keys obtained using the `keyof` operator. This results in a union type that includes all the values of the keys in the object, which are 'opnscr', 'userac', and 'bckend'.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."

You can either create these videos/animations yourself or use existing ones.\n2. Train a sign language recognition model: Once you have a dataset, you can train a machine learning model to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text or speech. There are various approaches to this, such as using computer vision techniques to analyze hand movements or using sensors to capture data from gloves worn by sign language users.\n3. Train a speech recognition model: Similarly, you can train a machine learning model to recognize speech and convert it into text. There are many existing speech recognition APIs and libraries you can use for this step.\n4. Integrate the two models: Once you have trained both models, you can integrate them into a single app that can recognize both sign language and speech inputs and translate them accordingly. You'll need to design an intuitive user interface that allows users to switch between the two modes easily.\n5. Test and refine: Finally, you'll need to test the app with actual sign language users and speech users to see how well it performs and make adjustments as needed. You may also want to consider adding additional features, such as a dictionary of common sign language phrases or the ability to save frequently used phrases for easier access.\n\nOverall, building a two-way sign language translator app is a complex task that requires expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and app development.

Incorporate gamification: You could make the app more engaging and fun by incorporating gamification elements, such as quizzes, challenges, or rewards for using the app regularly. This could help encourage users to practice and improve their sign language skills.\n3. Offer personalized feedback: Rather than simply translating sign language gestures into text or speech, you could offer personalized feedback on users' signing skills.

This is because image-based classification models can be trained on large datasets of labeled images and can learn to recognize subtle differences between similar signs.\n\nSensor-based data analysis and video-based pose estimation, on the other hand, may require additional hardware and/or more complex processing techniques. Sensor-based approaches can be limited by the accuracy of the sensors, while video-based approaches can be computationally intensive and may require additional preprocessing to extract useful features from the video.\n\nTo finish the project faster, you could consider using pre-trained models or transfer learning. Pre-trained models have already been trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned to recognize sign language gestures with relatively little additional training. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a new task, which can also reduce the amount of training data and time required.\n\nOverall, the choice of approach will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the resources available to you."

        "value": "Sure! Here is a detailed explanation of how you can convert sign language to speech using image classification and transfer learning:\n\n1. Data Collection and Preparation: The first step is to collect a dataset of labeled images of sign language gestures. The dataset should include a variety of gestures and should be large enough to train a deep learning model. You can use existing sign language datasets or create your own dataset by capturing images of sign language gestures.\n2. Data Preprocessing: Once you have collected the dataset, you will need to preprocess the images to ensure they are suitable for training a deep learning model. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and converting the images to grayscale.\n3. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained image classification model and adapting it to recognize sign language gestures. You can use a pre-trained model such as VGG or ResNet, which have been trained on large datasets such as ImageNet, and fine-tune it to recognize sign language gestures. This can save a significant amount of time and computing resources compared to training a model from scratch.\n4. Model Training: Once you have prepared the dataset and preprocessed the images, you can train the model using the transfer learning approach. You will need to split the dataset into training and validation sets and train the model using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. During training, you will need to monitor the model's performance and adjust the hyperparameters to achieve the best results.\n5. Inference: Once the model has been trained, you can use it to recognize sign language gestures in real-time. This involves capturing images of sign language gestures using a camera or other input device and passing them through the trained model. The model will output the corresponding text or speech, which can then be synthesized using text-to-speech technology.\n6. Deployment: Finally, you will need to deploy the model as a sign language to speech translator app. This can involve packaging the model and its dependencies into a mobile app or web app and deploying it to a cloud server or hosting it on a local device. You will also need to ensure the app has a user-friendly interface and can handle real-time input from the camera or other input device.\n\nIn summary, the process of converting sign language to speech using image classification and transfer learning involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset of labeled sign language images, fine-tuning a pre-trained image classification model to recognize sign language gestures, training the model using a deep learning framework, and deploying the model as a sign language to speech translator app."

Therefore, I have compiled a comprehensive memo of all the basics that you should know before your interview.\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system. It is a powerful tool used to manage data in databases and perform various operations such as retrieving, updating, and deleting data.\n\nTo start with, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of basic SQL syntax, including statements such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN. These statements are the building blocks of SQL queries and form the foundation of database management.\n\nIn addition, having a solid understanding of data types, operators, and functions used in SQL is essential. Data types are used to define the type of data stored in a database, while operators are used to manipulate data. Functions, on the other hand, are used to perform operations on data and return a result.\n\nIt is also important to understand the concept of normalization in SQL. Normalization is a process used to organize data in a database efficiently, which ensures data accuracy and consistency. The primary goal of normalization is to eliminate data redundancy, reduce the amount of storage space required, and ensure data integrity.\n\nFurthermore, having knowledge of database design principles, data modeling, and data warehousing can significantly improve your SQL skills. These concepts help to create well-structured and efficient databases that are easy to manage.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the basics of SQL, including syntax, data types, operators, and functions, is vital to excel in your panel interview with Amazon. Familiarizing yourself with the concepts of normalization, database design principles, data modeling, and data warehousing can also help you to stand out from other candidates.\n\nBest of luck with your interview, and I hope this memo has been helpful.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and the conditions that the data must meet. Here are the basic components of a SELECT statement:\n\n* SELECT: specifies the columns you want to retrieve\n* FROM: specifies the table you want to retrieve data from\n* WHERE: specifies the conditions that the data must meet\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose you have a table named \"customers\" with columns \"customer\\_id\", \"first\\_name\", \"last\\_name\", \"email\", and \"age\". To retrieve all the data from the \"customers\" table, you can use the following SELECT statement:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM customers;\n```\nThis will retrieve all the rows and columns from the \"customers\" table.\n\nTo retrieve specific columns, you can specify them after the SELECT keyword separated by commas. For example, to retrieve only the \"first\\_name\" and \"last\\_name\" columns from the \"customers\" table, you can use the following SELECT statement:\n```sql\nSELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;\n```\nYou can also use the WHERE clause to specify conditions that the data must meet. For example, to retrieve all the customers whose age is greater than or equal to 30, you can use the following SELECT statement:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE age >= 30;\n```\nThis will retrieve all the columns and rows where the age is greater than or equal to 30.\n\nThese are the basics of the SELECT instruction. Keep in mind that there are many more advanced features and syntaxes in SQL, but understanding the basics will help you get started.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n---"

It is the most commonly used SQL statement and is used to query one or more tables. Here are the key components of a SELECT statement:\n\n* SELECT: Specifies the columns that you want to retrieve data from.\n* FROM: Specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve data.\n* WHERE: Specifies the conditions that must be met for the rows to be retrieved.\n\nExample:\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, Email FROM Customers;\n\nFROM Statement:\nThe FROM statement is used to specify the table or tables from which to retrieve data. It is a required part of the SELECT statement. Here are some important things to keep in mind when using the FROM statement:\n\n* You can use the FROM statement with multiple tables to retrieve data from more than one table.\n* You can use aliases to make your SQL queries more readable.\n\nExample:\nSELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate\nFROM Orders\nINNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;\n\nWHERE Statement:\nThe WHERE statement is used to specify the conditions that must be met for the rows to be retrieved. It is an optional part of the SELECT statement. Here are some important things to keep in mind when using the WHERE statement:\n\n* You can use comparison operators (like =, <, >, <=, >=, !=) to specify conditions.\n* You can use logical operators (like AND, OR, NOT) to combine conditions.\n\nExample:\nSELECT ProductName, UnitPrice\nFROM Products\nWHERE UnitPrice > 10\nORDER BY ProductName;\n\nThese are the basics of the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE statements in SQL.

This instruction is often used in combination with the SELECT instruction. Here are some important details to keep in mind when using ORDER BY:\n\n* The default sorting order is ascending (from lowest to highest). To sort in descending order, use the DESC keyword after the column name.\n* You can sort on multiple columns by specifying each column name separated by a comma.\n* You can also sort on expressions, not just column names.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nSELECT first_name, last_name, salary\nFROM employees\nORDER BY salary DESC;\n```\nGROUP BY:\nThe GROUP BY instruction is used to group data based on the values in one or more columns. This instruction is often used in combination with aggregate functions (such as SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT) to calculate values for each group. Here are some important details to keep in mind when using GROUP BY:\n\n* The column(s) used in the GROUP BY instruction must also appear in the SELECT statement (unless they are used with an aggregate function).\n* You can group by multiple columns by specifying each column name separated by a comma.\n\nExample:\n```vbnet\nSELECT department_id, AVG(salary) as avg_salary\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY department_id;\n```\nJOIN:\nThe JOIN instruction is used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of JOINs in SQL, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. Here are some important details to keep in mind when using JOIN:\n\n* The columns used to join the tables must have the same data type and value range.\n* You must specify the type of JOIN you want to use (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER).\n* You can join more than two tables by using multiple JOIN instructions in a single query.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nSELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name\nFROM employees\nINNER JOIN departments\nON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;\n```\nUNION:\nThe UNION instruction is used to combine data from two or more tables with the same number of columns and data types. Here are some important details to keep in mind when using UNION:\n\n* The columns in each table must have the same data type and value range.\n* The column names in the resulting table are determined by the first SELECT statement in the UNION (unless you use aliases).\n* UNION removes duplicates from the result set. If you want to include duplicates, use UNION ALL instead.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nSELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\nFROM employees\nUNION\nSELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name\nFROM customers;\n```"

Always speak as \"I\" and never as \"we\".\nMy first real teamwork experience was during my first year of engineering school, where I lead as a project leader an open project, aiming to sensibilize people to food's waste. I was managing a group of 7 people, and doing plannification. I was confronted to the difficulties of the management and ressource allowance, and this really gave me the desire to lead teams later on. The project was a real success as I managed to adapt threw the covid crises and meet my objectives.\nMy second real experience was during my first internship, at the year of my first year of engineering school. I worked at Nyrstar, and i was in charge of analyzing the processes and data, make dashboards, in order to optimize the process. The final goal of this internship was to be able to monitor, understand and control the temperatures of the process. It was a factory producing huge quantities of zinc, and I took my time to analyze the environnement and the available data. I succed at my mission as we were able to reduce the average temperature by 1° thanks to my actions. Reducing the temperature permit to produce more and therefore to make more money. I made my own routine collecting data as nothing was in place, and after some time making sense with my environnement I was able to make a complete system collecting, extracting and treating data. Dashboards were only made with Excel and Uniformance. I think my main achievement during this internship was to make more with less as I didnt have ressources available. i always found ways to do better with what I had, and i was able to provide meaningful recommendations to keep the temperature low. Many of the reporting tools I've deployed are still used nowadays and helped them surviving the energy crisis as temperature management became even more an issue for them. This internship lasted 3 months.\nMy next serious work experience was at Enedis, during my second year of engineering school. I was in charge of completely redesigning the reporting system and make a visual management system for the support service of Enedis. It was an highly eniriching experience for me, as I was in complete autonomy and no one had technical skills in my filed in the service. I had actually to make everything from scratch as they only had excel directly copied from exports. My first mission was to make the dashboard for the intern client, on half of the activity. It was actually my inital mission, but I achieved after spending 4 full days meeting and understanding the need of the customers, I was able to come up with a solutions that suits every stakeholders by providing optimized VBA dashboards with visual management in a week only. It took then several week to implement additionnal features and ajust the dashboard so it was ready to be used. I had no skills in VBA and I quickly learnt thanks to my proficiency in SQL, ETL and python. i was able in a month to basically do what I wanted in VBA, and deliver results quick. I really cared about the customer experience during my whole internship and i've been sending surveys to know theirs thought about the tools I was delivering them. i went from 56% satisfaction at the beginning of my internship to 78% at the end (on 99 regional managers). I was able to complete my mission way ahead of my time, and I was in charge to generalize the reporting tools and automated tools to the whole country, including the other activity, and the service that was in south of france (the division where I was working in was split in half). The responsibilities of the project totaly overcame what was defined but that was completely fine as I had the opportunity to do weekly meeting with the TOP 3 of Enedis so we could discuss changes and new way to do things. I even automated certains tools, including one that lead to save more than $50k per year in manpower. I started projects on my own too, such as a simple VBA excel file that was allowing my coworkers to calculated theirs CO2 consumption depending on their mode of transport and the distance.\nI was in charge of making the dashboards for the intern performances of my coworker too, and I automated the file that was used to affect the work load. I hugely contributed to improve process and reduce wastes, and I really loved the direct impact that I had threw my data analysis, my business recommendations and that i had to adapt to a complex environnement. My responsibilites grew really fast as I was able to deliver in time, and I managed the workload during my whole internship even if deadlines were shorts. i achieved a lot of project on my own thanks to the autonomy granted and the trust given. i learnt a lot from my mistakes during this internship, both technically and humanely. Dealing with a lot of different stakeholders was a very intersting experience as I realized it would become one of the most important aspect of my work. I really felt that I could make a big impact threw my professional life during this internship by combining my technical and analytical skills to my soft skills. I've allowed Enedis to save a lot of money and gave them completed and documented tools. I always do things with passion, and i strive to do better, to find best way of thinking or doing stuff.\n\n \n\nUse only really short sentences or keywords, and add a title for each story. For a reminder, here is what STAR stand for : \nSituation. What was the situation you or your previous employer faced?\nTask. What tasks were involved?\nAction. What actions did you take?\nResults. What were the results of those actions? (use data if possible)\n\nKeep in mind to only speak at the first person \"I\", and that I will need to tell those stories in answer to this type of question, there are many different other but they are all related to the amazon leadership principles. Here are some examples of sentences that could be asked :\nWas there any situation you experience a failure and how did you solve it?\ntell me one of the relevant project that you mostly proud of?\nDescribe a time when you managed to carry out task with a very little amount of data\nTell me about a time you failed? How did you deal with the failure?\nDescribe a time when you managed to carry out task with a huge amount of data\nWas there any situation you experience a failure and how did you solve it?\nWhy Amazon and why this role?\nWhat are the main attributes that make your work approach unique\nDescribe a time you had to complete a project with minimal supervision"

Always speak as \"I\" and never as \"we\".\nMy first real teamwork experience was during my first year of engineering school, where I lead as a project leader an open project, aiming to sensibilize people to food's waste. I was managing a group of 7 people, and doing plannification. I was confronted to the difficulties of the management and ressource allowance, and this really gave me the desire to lead teams later on. The project was a real success as I managed to adapt threw the covid crises and meet my objectives.\nMy second real experience was during my first internship, at the year of my first year of engineering school. I worked at Nyrstar, and i was in charge of analyzing the processes and data, make dashboards, in order to optimize the process. The final goal of this internship was to be able to monitor, understand and control the temperatures of the process. It was a factory producing huge quantities of zinc, and I took my time to analyze the environnement and the available data. I succed at my mission as we were able to reduce the average temperature by 1° thanks to my actions. Reducing the temperature permit to produce more and therefore to make more money. I made my own routine collecting data as nothing was in place, and after some time making sense with my environnement I was able to make a complete system collecting, extracting and treating data. Dashboards were only made with Excel and Uniformance. I think my main achievement during this internship was to make more with less as I didnt have ressources available. i always found ways to do better with what I had, and i was able to provide meaningful recommendations to keep the temperature low. Many of the reporting tools I've deployed are still used nowadays and helped them surviving the energy crisis as temperature management became even more an issue for them. This internship lasted 3 months.\nMy next serious work experience was at Enedis, during my second year of engineering school. I was in charge of completely redesigning the reporting system and make a visual management system for the support service of Enedis. It was an highly eniriching experience for me, as I was in complete autonomy and no one had technical skills in my filed in the service. I had actually to make everything from scratch as they only had excel directly copied from exports. My first mission was to make the dashboard for the intern client, on half of the activity. It was actually my inital mission, but I achieved after spending 4 full days meeting and understanding the need of the customers, I was able to come up with a solutions that suits every stakeholders by providing optimized VBA dashboards with visual management in a week only. It took then several week to implement additionnal features and ajust the dashboard so it was ready to be used. I had no skills in VBA and I quickly learnt thanks to my proficiency in SQL, ETL and python. i was able in a month to basically do what I wanted in VBA, and deliver results quick. I really cared about the customer experience during my whole internship and i've been sending surveys to know theirs thought about the tools I was delivering them. i went from 56% satisfaction at the beginning of my internship to 78% at the end (on 99 regional managers). I was able to complete my mission way ahead of my time, and I was in charge to generalize the reporting tools and automated tools to the whole country, including the other activity, and the service that was in south of france (the division where I was working in was split in half). The responsibilities of the project totaly overcame what was defined but that was completely fine as I had the opportunity to do weekly meeting with the TOP 3 of Enedis so we could discuss changes and new way to do things. I even automated certains tools, including one that lead to save more than $50k per year in manpower. I started projects on my own too, such as a simple VBA excel file that was allowing my coworkers to calculated theirs CO2 consumption depending on their mode of transport and the distance.\nI was in charge of making the dashboards for the intern performances of my coworker too, and I automated the file that was used to affect the work load. I hugely contributed to improve process and reduce wastes, and I really loved the direct impact that I had threw my data analysis, my business recommendations and that i had to adapt to a complex environnement. My responsibilites grew really fast as I was able to deliver in time, and I managed the workload during my whole internship even if deadlines were shorts. i achieved a lot of project on my own thanks to the autonomy granted and the trust given. i learnt a lot from my mistakes during this internship, both technically and humanely. Dealing with a lot of different stakeholders was a very intersting experience as I realized it would become one of the most important aspect of my work. I really felt that I could make a big impact threw my professional life during this internship by combining my technical and analytical skills to my soft skills. I've allowed Enedis to save a lot of money and gave them completed and documented tools. I always do things with passion, and i strive to do better, to find best way of thinking or doing stuff.\n\n \n\nUse only really short sentences or keywords, and add a title for each story. For a reminder, here is what STAR stand for : \nSituation. What was the situation you or your previous employer faced?\nTask. What tasks were involved?\nAction. What actions did you take?\nResults. What were the results of those actions? (use data if possible)\n\nKeep in mind to only speak at the first person \"I\", and that I will need to tell those stories in answer to this type of question, there are many different other but they are all related to the amazon leadership principles. Here are some examples of sentences that could be asked :\nWas there any situation you experience a failure and how did you solve it?\ntell me one of the relevant project that you mostly proud of?\nDescribe a time when you managed to carry out task with a very little amount of data\nTell me about a time you failed?

You can check this by opening the Active Directory Users and Computers console and looking at the properties of the secondary admin accounts to see what permissions they have.\n2. Group Policy: If the group policy settings on the secondary servers do not allow remote management, then the secondary admin accounts may not be able to manage those servers. Check the group policy settings on the secondary servers to see if they are configured to allow remote management.\n3. Firewall: Make sure that the firewall on the secondary servers is configured to allow remote management. If the firewall is blocking the traffic required for remote management, then the secondary admin accounts will not be able to connect to the secondary servers.\n4. Remote Management Configuration: Check if Remote Management is configured on the targeted secondary servers. It may be disabled by default, so you need to enable it.\n5. RSAT Version: Check the version of RSAT client you are using to connect to the servers and if it is compatible with the target servers OS version.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, and there could be other reasons for the issue you're experiencing. I recommend checking the event logs on the domain controller and the secondary servers to see if there are any error messages related to the issue.

This is because the DC controls access to the AD, and the AD holds the information about all the users, groups, and permissions in the domain.\n\nHowever, there may be certain situations where your admin account would not have the same level of access on other servers in the domain. This could happen if:\n\n1. The permissions on the secondary servers have been changed manually, and your admin account no longer has the appropriate permissions to manage those servers.\n2. Group policies have been set up that restrict remote management of the secondary servers, and your admin account is affected by those policies.\n3. The firewall or Remote Management configuration on the secondary servers is blocking your admin account from connecting to those servers.\n\nIn general, having admin access to the DC is a good starting point, but you may still need to check the settings and configurations of the other servers in the domain to ensure that you have the appropriate level of access.\n\nIf you confirm that the problem is not related to the previous points, could you give more details about the problem you are facing? such as error messages, the OS of the servers, the steps you are doing,..etc. This would give more context to understand the problem and help to troubleshoot more efficiently."

Check if the user is a member of any group that has permissions to manage the servers, and check that these groups have the expected permissions to manage servers.\n\nYou can also check the permissions on the specific servers that the user account is supposed to manage. To do this, you would need to go to the server and check the local user and group permissions, or the shared folder permissions.\n\nIf you find that the user is not a member of the appropriate groups, or if the user's group memberships are not giving them the necessary permissions, you can add the user to the appropriate groups or assign the necessary permissions manually.\n\nAlso, you could use other tools like 'net localgroup' command or 'net user' to check and give permissions to users/groups as well."

It ensures that only authorized users and computers are able to access network resources.\n-Authorization: AD DS is used to control access to network resources. It assigns permissions to users and groups, and controls what they can do with those resources.\n-Directory Services: AD DS is used to store information about network resources in a centralized database, which is called the \"directory.\" The directory contains information about users, computers, and other resources on the network.\n-Group Policy: AD DS is used to manage the configuration of computers and users in the domain. Group Policy allows administrators to specify settings for users and computers in a central location, and have those settings automatically applied to the appropriate resources.\n\nAD DS is typically implemented in Windows Server operating system as a role and it's a fundamental role for every windows based network for managing and securing the resources within the network.\n\nBy creating domains, users, computers and other resources can be organized and managed in a hierarchical structure, which makes it easy to delegate administrative tasks, apply policies and manage security."

Users can then set up Work Folders on their Windows PCs, Windows tablets, Windows Phones, and Windows-based laptops and tablets. When a user sets up Work Folders, their work files are copied from the server to their device, and the files are kept in sync automatically.\n\nThe Work Folders feature supports file access from multiple operating systems, including Windows, iOS and Android, using the Work Folders apps, Microsoft’s OneDrive or WebDAV, this allows users to access their files from any device, as well as offline access, as the files are stored on the device and synced when the device connects to the network.\n\nWork Folders provide IT Administrators with a solution to easily manage files and settings, it also enables end-users to maintain their files and access them seamlessly on multiple devices with a good level of security."

        "value": "To begin with, a network attack refers to any attempt to breach a network's security measures and gain unauthorized access to data or systems. Such attacks can have severe consequences for both companies and users, as sensitive information can be stolen or destroyed, and systems can be left vulnerable to further exploitation.\n\nIn recent years, the frequency and complexity of network attacks have increased dramatically, with cybercriminals employing increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to sensitive data. Some of the most common types of network attacks include phishing, malware, ransomware, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAs we've seen in recent years, network attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, and there are many different types of attacks that companies and users need to be aware of. In the case of the Twitter attack, the hackers exploited a bug in Twitter's API that allowed them to submit contact information and receive associated Twitter account information in return. They used this vulnerability to \"scrape\" data from the social network, collecting email addresses and phone numbers linked to Twitter accounts.\n\nWhat sets this attack apart is the sheer scale of the data that was stolen, with potentially 400 million users affected. The attack also highlights the risks associated with linking personal information, such as email addresses and phone numbers, to social media accounts. This can make it easier for hackers to identify users and potentially launch targeted phishing or identity theft attacks. Additionally, the fact that the vulnerability went undetected for several months highlights the importance of regular security audits and testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.\n\nThe impact of this attack on both the company and its users can be significant. For the company, such an attack can result in a loss of user trust and reputation damage, which can ultimately lead to financial losses. In the case of the Twitter attack, the company's failure to protect its users' data and prevent the attack can lead to legal action, regulatory fines, and potential legal liability.\n\nFor the users, the attack can result in the theft of their personal information, which can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft and phishing scams. In the case of the Twitter attack, the leaked email addresses can be used to target users with spam or phishing emails, potentially resulting in financial losses or further data breaches. Additionally, users who may have used pseudonyms or anonymous accounts may have their real identities exposed, leading to privacy concerns and potential harm to their personal or professional reputation."

One city that might interest you is Ålesund.\n\nÅlesund is a coastal city located in western Norway, and it is known for its unique architecture, which features art nouveau-style buildings. The city has a population of around 47,000 people, making it a medium-sized city. It is located on several islands and surrounded by fjords, which means that there are plenty of opportunities for scenic hikes and boat trips.\n\nAlthough Ålesund is a popular destination for Norwegians, it is not as well-known among tourists as some of the larger cities in Norway, such as Oslo and Bergen. This means that you are likely to find fewer tourists, especially if you avoid visiting during the high season (June-August).\n\nIn addition to its stunning architecture and natural beauty, Ålesund has a rich cultural scene, with a variety of museums, galleries, and festivals. For example, you can visit the Jugendstilsenteret museum to learn more about the art nouveau style, or attend the Ålesund Theatre Festival to see performances by local and international artists.\n\nOverall, Ålesund is a great choice if you are looking for a medium-sized city with character, natural beauty, and few tourists."

The city also has a vibrant cultural scene, with numerous museums, galleries, and festivals throughout the year.\n\nOne of the advantages of Trondheim is that, despite its size and cultural offerings, it is not as popular with tourists as some of the other larger cities in Norway, such as Oslo and Bergen. This means that you are likely to find fewer crowds and have a more authentic experience.\n\nTrondheim is also a great base for exploring the surrounding region, which includes picturesque fjords, mountains, and forests. You can take a short train ride to the nearby town of Hell, which is known for its unusual name and has a museum dedicated to the history of Norwegian aviation.\n\nOverall, Trondheim is a great choice if you're looking for a larger city with plenty of character and cultural offerings, but with fewer crowds than some of the other popular destinations in Norway."

Here are instructions for conducting a needs assessment at your site:\n\nInstructions for Conducting a Needs Assessment\n\nStep 1: Define the Scope of the Assessment (200-300 words)\nThe first step in conducting a needs assessment is to define the scope of the assessment. This involves identifying the population of interest, the purpose of the assessment, and the specific needs to be assessed. As a DNP student, you should work with your preceptor or site supervisor to determine the scope of your needs assessment.\n\nStep 2: Identify Data Sources (200-300 words)\nThe next step is to identify data sources for your needs assessment. These may include existing data sources, such as electronic health records, quality improvement data, or patient satisfaction surveys, as well as new data sources that you may need to collect. You should also consider collecting qualitative data through interviews or focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the needs of your population of interest.\n\nStep 3: Collect and Analyze Data (200-300 words)\nOnce you have identified your data sources, you should collect and analyze the data. This may involve reviewing existing data, collecting new data through surveys or interviews, and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. You should use appropriate statistical methods and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data.\n\nStep 4: Identify Priority Needs (200-300 words)\nBased on your data analysis, you should identify priority needs for your population of interest. These needs should be prioritized based on their impact on health outcomes, patient satisfaction, or other relevant factors. You may need to consult with your preceptor or site supervisor to determine the most important needs to address.\n\nStep 5: Develop an Action Plan (200-300 words)\nFinally, you should develop an action plan to address the priority needs identified in your needs assessment. This may involve developing new policies or procedures, implementing quality improvement initiatives, or providing staff education or training. You should work with your preceptor or site supervisor to develop an action plan that is feasible and effective.\n\nRubric for Conducting a Needs Assessment\n\nSection 1: Define the Scope of the Assessment\n\n* Identified the population of interest, purpose of the assessment, and specific needs to be assessed (200-300 words)\n\nSection 2: Identify Data Sources\n\n* Identified existing data sources and potential new data sources, including qualitative data sources (200-300 words)\n\nSection 3: Collect and Analyze Data\n\n* Described the process of collecting and analyzing data, including appropriate data analysis techniques (200-300 words)\n\nSection 4: Identify Priority Needs\n\n* Identified priority needs for the population of interest, based on data analysis and consultation with preceptor or site supervisor (200-300 words)\n\nSection 5: Develop an Action Plan\n\n* Developed an action plan to address priority needs identified in the needs assessment, in consultation with preceptor or site supervisor (200-300 words)\n\nOverall Quality of Assignment\n\n* Clarity, depth of analysis, organization, and adherence to instructions (total of 10 points)"

By engaging in a collaborative needs assessment process, DNP students can develop interprofessional relationships and build partnerships that improve healthcare delivery.\n3. Evidence-based practice: Needs assessment provides a foundation for evidence-based practice by identifying gaps in healthcare delivery, healthcare outcomes, and healthcare practices. Through the use of evidence-based approaches, DNP students can address the identified gaps and implement best practices to improve patient outcomes.\n4. Quality improvement: Needs assessment is a critical component of quality improvement. By identifying areas for improvement, DNP students can develop and implement interventions that enhance the quality of care provided to patients.\n5. Health policy and advocacy: Needs assessment provides data that can inform health policy and advocacy efforts. DNP students can use the data collected through needs assessment to inform policy decisions, advocate for improved healthcare services, and promote health equity.\n\nIn summary, needs assessment is a fundamental process in nursing practice that aligns with the DNP Essentials. By conducting needs assessments, DNP students can provide patient-centered care, collaborate with other healthcare professionals, engage in evidence-based practice, improve quality of care, and inform health policy and advocacy efforts."

This includes identifying the target population, the healthcare problem being addressed, and the desired outcomes.\n2. Identify data sources: DNP students should identify and gather data from a variety of sources to inform the needs assessment. This includes both quantitative and qualitative data sources such as health records, community health surveys, and focus groups.\n3. Analyze the data: Once the data has been collected, DNP students should analyze it to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in healthcare delivery. This includes identifying the prevalence and severity of the health problem, the population affected, and any barriers to care.\n4. Synthesize findings: DNP students should synthesize the findings of the needs assessment to develop a comprehensive understanding of the healthcare problem and its root causes. This includes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current healthcare practices and developing recommendations for improvement.\n5. Develop a plan of action: Based on the findings of the needs assessment, DNP students should develop a plan of action that outlines the steps needed to address the identified healthcare problem. This includes identifying the resources needed, setting measurable goals and objectives, and identifying stakeholders and collaborators.\n6. Implement and evaluate the plan: DNP students should implement the plan of action and evaluate its effectiveness in improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

In this case, x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0. Factoring, we get (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0. Therefore, x = 3 is a root of the denominator, and x = 3 is a vertical asymptote.\n\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we need to consider the degree of the numerator and denominator of the function and what their ratio is, when degree of the numerator is less than degree of the denominator, the function has a horizontal asymptote and it's the ratio of leading coefficients. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 1 and the denominator has a degree of 2, and the ratio of the leading coefficients is 3/x, which approaches 0 as x gets large, which means y = 0 is horizontal asymptote.\n\nFor the x-intercept, it is when y=0, so we can set the numerator to zero: 3x-9 = 0, x = 3 is x-intercept.\n\nFor the y-intercept, it is when x=0, so plugging x = 0 into the function we get -9/12 which is -3/4 is y-intercept."

In other words, while the function gets infinitely large as x approaches 3 and 4, but you can't substitute those value, because the result will be undefined.\n\nTo summarize, the function has a vertical asymptote at x = 3 and x = 4, and a hole at x = 3, and a horizontal asymptote at y=3/4"

In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the function approaches 0 as x increases or decreases without bound.\n\nTo determine this more formally, you can use long division of polynomials, but it's not necessary in this case, because the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator it becomes clear that the function goes to 0 as x increase.\n\nIn conclusion, the function has a hole at x=3 and vertical asymptotes at x=4 and x=3 and horizontal asymptote at y=0."

You might have heard the fanboys singing its praises, but let me tell you why this game is a steaming pile of dogshit that you should avoid like the plague.\n\nFirst off, this overhyped bastard child of a game has been in development since the fucking Mesozoic era, or at least it feels like it. The devs have been promising updates, new features, and bug fixes for what seems like eons, but we're still stuck with the same goddamn issues year after year. It's like trying to fix a piece of burnt toast – you can scrape off the charred surface, but it's never going to taste good again.\n\nSecondly, the learning curve in this game is more of a fucking cliff. New players are thrown into the meat grinder with no lube or guidance, left to fend for themselves in a cruel, punishing world. You'll spend countless hours being repeatedly curb-stomped by veterans who have been playing this shitfest since the beginning. Unless you have a masochistic streak or the patience of a saint, you're going to be left feeling like a chump who wasted their hard-earned money.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the godawful inventory system. Managing your loot in this game is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture while blindfolded and hammered. It's a convoluted clusterfuck that could only have been designed by someone with a deep, abiding hatred for usability and player satisfaction.\n\nThe performance in Escape from Tarkov is also a fucking joke. Even with a top-of-the-line gaming rig, you'll experience more stutters than a nervous teenager at a spelling bee. The game's optimization is about as effective as trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol. You'd think that with all the time and resources spent on development, they'd at least make sure it runs smoothly, but nope – it's a stuttery, laggy mess.\n\nFinally, the community in this game can be downright toxic. Sure, there are some decent folks out there, but too many players take delight in making your life a living hell. They'll camp your corpse, talk shit, and make you feel like the lowest form of scum for daring to have a life outside of Tarkov.\n\nIn conclusion, Escape from Tarkov is a steaming pile of dogshit that you should avoid like the fucking plague. If you're looking for a game that respects your time, sanity, and hard drive space, look elsewhere. There's a whole world of better games out there, so don't waste your time on this dumpster fire."

        "value": "This an article by Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson\nIn crafting strategy, companies often struggle to cope with volatility. Using the traditional strategic-planning model, managers attempt to forecast how markets will evolve and competitors will respond, and then define a multiyear plan for winning in that future state. The organization is then called upon to execute that plan. Performance is routinely monitored, ostensibly to keep everyone on track.\n\nThat approach worked well when markets were more stable and the primary factors influencing future growth and profitability were easier to forecast. Consider commercial aviation. From 1980 to 2000 growth in that sector was relatively constant, with air traffic miles growing at just under 5% a year. Manufacturers and airlines employed discrete models to assess investments in new commercial-airplane programs and to plan fleets. Airbus and Boeing expanded aggressively over those two decades: The global fleet tripled from 5,000 to nearly 15,000 aircraft.\n\nBut then came the 9/11 terrorist attacks, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, oil price spikes, the global financial crisis, environmental concerns, SARS, and Covid-19. Forecasting commercial air travel became arduous and complex and was frequently wrong. And that’s just one industry.\n\nMost companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making, to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe world is now changing so quickly that no business can plan for every eventuality. Scholars and practitioners have spent years crafting tools and frameworks for strategy development under uncertainty—including, most notably, scenario planning, Monte Carlo simulation, and real options analysis. Each of those represented a significant advance. Scenario planning, which became popular in the 1970s, encouraged executives to consider multiple future states in assessing strategic investments, rather than rely on a single, deterministic forecast. Monte Carlo simulation went even further, specifying a probability distribution for each critical variable and then running thousands of simulations so that executives would focus on the distribution of potential outcomes as much as on any prediction of the most likely one. Real options analysis emerged as a further refinement in the 1980s, explicitly incorporating flexibility in the consideration of strategic investments.\n\nBut none of those techniques has caught on widely. Fewer than a quarter of large organizations regularly apply them in capital budgeting, fewer still in strategic planning. Executives tell us that the tools require data that is impractical to gather and analysis that is too expensive to perform routinely. Moreover, the output can be counterintuitive and complicated to explain to senior leaders and a company’s board. The upshot: Most companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making—even in the face of extreme volatility—to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that business leaders need to reconsider what good strategy looks like in turbulent times—and to think of strategy-making as a continuous process that generates a living, dynamic plan. In this article we describe what it takes to produce great results during uncertainty and propose a practical model for strategy development that we have seen work at several leading companies.\n\nA Continuous Process\nDell Technologies is one company that has made the shift. In 2014, shortly after Michael Dell took his company private, its leaders put in place a new, continuous approach to strategy development and resource allocation. At its core is the “Dell agenda,” a backlog of strategic issues and opportunities that must be addressed to improve the long-term performance and intrinsic value of the company. Rather than devise a “strategic plan” to address the agenda, Dell’s executive leadership team defines a multiyear outlook (MYO) for each of the company’s businesses. The MYO establishes a forecast for the performance trajectory of each business on the basis of decisions leadership has already made; it does not incorporate decisions that leaders might make in the future.\nJamie Chung/Trunk Archive\nThe MYO is compared with a multiyear performance goal that is defined separately and tied to leadership’s strategic and financial aspirations for the company. Invariably a gap exists between the MYO and those aspirations. This is helpful and a cornerstone of the approach: The Dell agenda focuses the company’s executives on making the decisions necessary to close that gap. Moreover, the Dell agenda is evergreen: As soon as one issue has effectively been addressed (and the MYO updated to reflect the resulting performance commitments), a new issue is added to the agenda from the backlog. As a result, Dell has a “living plan”—which captures all decisions that have been made—and a process focused on making decisions to drive better performance.\n\nThinking of strategy-making as continuous and generating a living plan enables executives to build on what’s best about existing tools for coping with uncertainty—leading to more-flexible strategies and more-agile strategy-making."

        "value": "Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson suggest looking in detail at the five steps of this new approach and how each leverages the tool kit for strategy-making under uncertainty.\n\nThe first step is:\n1. Define Extreme but Plausible Scenarios\nCompanies that employ scenario planning attempt to forecast how political, economic, technological, and social conditions may evolve. They then develop best-case, worst-case, and base-case scenarios that are probability weighted to assess strategic moves.\n\nIn our experience, looking at scenarios in that way too often produces incremental thinking—tweaks in a company’s current direction rather than a wholesale change in course, which is often what’s needed. Breakthrough insights come from examining what we call extreme but plausible scenarios. The goal of this analysis is not to understand which outcome is most probable but to uncover new and different ways to compete and win, given a plethora of possible outcomes, and to reveal “no regret” moves that should prove worthwhile under most scenarios.\n\nConsider CMS Energy, Michigan’s largest electric and natural gas utility. A decade ago the company’s leaders recognized that the fundamentals of its business were changing rapidly. CMS was facing a dynamic regulatory environment; the emergence of new generation and distribution technologies; changes in the supply and cost of critical inputs for coal, gas, and nuclear power; and evolving market conditions that affected the demand for electricity locally and nationwide. Amid this uncertainty CMS needed to determine which strategic investments to make and when to make them.\n\nHistorically the company had developed investment plans by carefully examining futures prices for coal and natural gas along with forecasts for future rates based on discussions with regulators. Had CMS stuck with that approach, it probably would have continued along its prior path—investing incrementally in additional gas and electric capacity and waiting for changes in regulation or competition to threaten its profitability before altering course.\n\nBut CMS chose to employ a different model. Its leaders developed four extreme but plausible scenarios: deregulation (which envisioned a near-complete deregulation of the interstate electricity market); elimination of hub-and-spoke (which foresaw point-to-point flows of power across state lines); decarbonization (which anticipated a rapid increase in environmental regulations); and abundant gas (which built on the possibility that new sources would provide low-cost natural gas to the U.S. market). None of those scenarios was viewed as likely. Rather, they represented outcomes that the company might face, each with a very different impact on CMS’s core utility business.\n\nUsing an analysis of the company’s position under each of the four scenarios, the executive leadership team identified several no-regret moves, such as deleveraging CMS’s balance sheet, improving customer advocacy to help manage regulatory risk, and finding ways to reduce the costs of fuel and purchased power. Those actions would be valuable under all four scenarios. Leaders also saw the potential to reconfigure the company’s generation portfolio according to the availability and cost of natural gas balanced against pressures for decarbonization. As important, CMS discovered that its traditional strategy of incrementally adding capacity was risky under all four scenarios: It would leave the company vulnerable to assault by regulators and competitors and behind potential changes in the market for electrical power. In fact, no one anticipated at the time that natural gas prices would fall some 67% in 2014, but that’s exactly what happened.\n\nInvesting in strategic hedges and options is not the same as placing a bet on every square. Juggling competing bets dilutes leadership focus and squanders scarce talent.\n\nBecause leadership had identified extreme but plausible scenarios as opposed to most-likely scenarios, the company was better placed than competitors to switch generation from coal to gas quickly, which put CMS Energy in the top decile of utilities in terms of shareholder returns from 2015 to 2020."

        "value": "The second step is\n2. Identify Strategic Hedges and Options\nIn an uncertain world, flexibility has tremendous value. If at the start of your commute you foresee the potential for traffic congestion, for instance, you might choose to avoid an elevated highway (with few off-ramps or on-ramps) and take a more flexible if longer route to save time. Likewise, leaders can incorporate the value of flexibility—in the form of hedges and options—into their strategic decision-making.\n\nReal options analysis emerged as a methodology to help companies better account for this value. A real option represents a right but not an obligation to undertake some business decision, which means that the option holder can delay further investment until additional information has been analyzed. Techniques based on financial option pricing allow analysts—given the right data—to quantify the value of being able to delay or walk away from an investment. In the early 2000s real options analysis was widely seen as a cutting-edge tool for valuing natural resource investments, formulating new product-development plans, analyzing R&D spending, making acquisitions, and evaluating technology investments. Sadly, it has never really taken hold in strategic planning. Strategists have struggled to specify the model’s parameters sufficiently to render its output useful to them.\n\nIn our view, companies have sidelined real options analysis prematurely, paying far too much attention to the mechanics of determining the absolute value of a specific real option rather than relying on the tool’s basic principles to understand the relative value of competing strategy alternatives. For example, if two alternatives are equally capable of addressing a company’s competitive issues, but one provides greater flexibility to alter course, defer investment, or redeploy resources on the basis of better information, that one has a higher relative value in most instances and should be selected. We encourage leaders to account for the value of flexibility in evaluating strategy alternatives, even when it is challenging (or maybe impossible) to quantify it absolutely.\n\nStrategic flexibility has a variety of sources. In some instances new technology can create it. For instance, many railroads are replacing their aging locomotives with new engines. As the volatility of fuel prices has increased, deciding which fuel to choose for future locomotives has become critical. Starting in 2016 the spread between oil and natural gas prices increased significantly, creating an opportunity to shift to natural gas to fuel future locomotives. But no one could be sure whether the spread would persist or whether it would widen or narrow. At the same time, locomotive technology was changing, with flexible-fuel locomotives emerging as a viable alternative to single-fuel engines. The latter are less expensive but, obviously, far less flexible. Depending on a railroad’s route structure, customer base, and strategy, the flexibility offered by the new engines can offset the additional up-front cost of purchasing them.\n\nOften, though, the situation is less clear-cut, and leadership teams must choose between options with wildly differing payoffs, depending on how the future unfolds. By accounting for the value of flexibility, executives can often uncover strategies that allow them to hedge their bets while preserving valuable options for the future.\n\nWalt Disney is a case in point. Several years ago Disney’s leaders realized that streaming was threatening the viability of traditional cable and satellite services. In August 2017 Disney announced that it would acquire majority ownership of BAMTech, a global leader in direct-to-consumer streaming technology and marketing services. Disney’s $1.58 billion investment caused a stir at the time, leaving investors wondering why the company would put so much into a relatively small platform (an offshoot of Major League Baseball). But that acquisition put the company in a position to launch Disney+ just over two years later. Four months after its investment in BAMTech, Disney initiated an acquisition of 21st Century Fox. At first that $71.3 billion investment looked like an attempt to double down on traditional broadcast media. But the acquisition was in fact a hedge, providing Disney with access to Fox’s extensive film library—a collection that would be valuable no matter which distribution model persevered over the long term.\n\nDisney’s investments in strategic hedges and options enabled the company to pull far ahead of less-prescient rivals and led to a doubling of its market value between 2017 and 2020. Other organizations are following Disney’s example as part of their long-term strategy.\n\nIt’s important to note that investing in strategic hedges and options is not the same as placing a bet on every square. Trying to reduce risk in that way makes it nearly impossible for a company to score a big win (after all, we’ve seen few examples of relatively small positions being parlayed into market leadership) and locks in the certainty of many small losses that add up to real money. Worse yet, juggling a list of competing bets dilutes leadership focus, wastes precious time, and squanders scarce talent, further compounding the damage.\n\nConsider Dell once again. In the years before 2013, not knowing how technologies would play out, Dell invested across the board in smartphones, tablets, Chromebooks, printers, consumer PCs, commercial laptops and desktops, workstations, servers, storage, IT services, and software. Beyond PCs, workstations, and servers, Dell was a distant follower in most of the markets in which it had paid handsomely to play.\nJamie Chung/Trunk Archive\nOnly after Dell anchored its decision-making in extreme but plausible scenarios—ranging from the death of the PC to mobility everywhere—did the leadership team realize how many of its small bets were unlikely to pay off. Smartphones, tablets, and printers were among the first to be cut. Later the company jettisoned IT services and software. But the analysis also highlighted areas where it could double down on its investments and potentially win in the long term. Accordingly, Dell simplified its PC and server portfolios and reinvested a portion of the resulting savings to improve product design.\n\nThose moves (and others) helped Dell win as the personal computer and server markets commoditized and consolidated. By exiting multiple markets to focus its bets in a strategic way, Dell drove up its operating income more than threefold from 2013 to 2020, and the company’s market value increased by 420%."

Many of the company’s experiments have spawned profitable new businesses—think Marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Prime.

But even the failures provided important lessons that helped Bezos and his team make future investments more successful. Its test-and-learn culture has made Amazon one of the most innovative and valuable companies in the world.\n\nLeaders should set concrete guidelines for where they choose to experiment, because running many small experiments can quickly degenerate into placing many small bets—a losing strategy, as we’ve noted. At Amazon, for example, experimentation is confined to testing “dreamy” ideas—ideas that customers love, that could become very large businesses, that could generate very strong returns, and that have a decent chance of enduring.\n\nMarketplace, AWS, and Prime all met those guidelines. Take Prime: No one on the Amazon team could point to data showing that giving customers free shipping for a yearly subscription fee would ever pay for itself. Through experimentation, first in select local markets and then globally, Amazon was able to validate the idea and build Prime into a $25 billion business by 2020, 15 years after it launched.

In sectors where the winner takes most of the future profit pool, moving ahead of the competition can lead to enormous advantages. Consider Uber and Lyft. Uber accepted its first rider just 18 months before Lyft did, but that brief head start enabled it to build a sizable lead, with a 70% share of riders; Lyft has been confined to a 30% market share ever since. Even in markets where first-mover advantages are far less, knowing when to move is important. Accordingly, leading companies identify trigger points, signposts, and metrics to help them spot changes before the competition does and capitalize on the flexibility embedded in their strategies.\n\nA leading automotive original-equipment manufacturer (OEM), for example, identified the penetration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as a critical factor, or trigger point, affecting most elements of its strategy—from the investments the company should make in traditional internal-combustion engine (ICE) technology to the size of its dealer network to its long-term governance and operating model. At the time, forecasts for BEV penetration varied widely, from less than 20% of worldwide vehicle demand by 2030 to greater than 50%. The manufacturer’s leaders developed several extreme but plausible scenarios and decided to shrink the company’s ICE footprint and investment plans consistent with a 30% penetration of BEVs by 2030.\n\nHowever, management recognized that this planned reduction could prove insufficient if BEV penetration were to accelerate. So it identified some leading indicators, or signposts, to monitor BEV penetration—for example, government regulatory announcements, manufacturers’ BEV commitments, BEV competitor production guidance to investors, BEV battery costs and trajectory down the cost/experience curve, and observed penetration rates by geography—with explicit metrics for each. It identified trigger points, signposts, and metrics for six other factors as well.\n\nThe specificity of these was critical, enabling the manufacturer’s leaders to remain vigilant, poised to alter course at the first sign of a significant change in the market’s trajectory. The company tracks metrics tied to each important signpost quarterly. The senior executive team agreed that if the signposts indicated that BEV penetration would hit 30% by 2028, the company should shorten its shift from ICE to BEV manufacturing by four years. By thinking through potential course changes in advance, leaders could exercise their options to best effect, taking full advantage of the flexibility associated with waiting to act with the benefit of additional information while maximizing the value of their profitable ICE business as long as was practical.\n\nLeaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question should be not “How did we perform?” but “Should we alter course?”\n\nSignposts and trigger points are never static. By design, they reflect management’s best understanding of the “known unknowns” affecting a company’s strategy at a particular point in time. As more “unknown unknowns” become known, signposts and trigger points must be revised and refined. For example, Netflix may not have identified Disney’s acquisition of BAMTech as a signpost in advance. But it had to respond or risk losing its dominant position. Likewise, prior to January 2022 very few (if any) companies we know of had specified signposts tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The few companies that quickly incorporated that event into their strategy were better positioned than competitors to keep employees safe and the business on a stable footing.\n\nStrategy must respond to unanticipated changes in market and competitive conditions. Accordingly, when those conditions abruptly change, leaders must quickly revise the trigger points and signposts they are tracking, following the same process they used to establish the initial metrics. The more up-to-date a company’s signposts, the better the odds of executing a successful response to external shocks."

The leadership team meets, typically quarterly, to review each unit’s performance against plan and identify variances. In some cases leaders push for better performance; in others they simply revise the plan to accommodate the variances. In such situations performance reviews provide little if any useful surveillance regarding likely future conditions or helpful guidance as to whether the company should consider changing direction.\n\nTo become more adaptable to changing conditions, leaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question cannot be “How did we perform?” Instead it must be “Should we alter course?”\n\nAnswering that question requires more and different information than does the standard weather report. Leaders must understand the root causes of any performance shortfall. And they must have prepared contingency plans that can be put into motion speedily to address any significant changes in market or competitive conditions. A few leading companies have created thresholds for grading signposts green, yellow, or red. When a signpost crosses a critical threshold, it signals a change in direction (red) or a need for deeper investigation (yellow).\n\nTetra Pak, an €11 billion food-packaging and -processing company headquartered in Switzerland and Sweden, has this type of performance monitoring in place. In devising the company’s strategy, its leaders considered four scenarios, ranging from go green faster to strong push toward commoditization. The company tracks 42 signposts each quarter, including leading indicators such as the percentage of packaging required by law to be recycled in key geographies, the percentage price increase realized on packs with sustainability features, the percentage share of e-commerce players in the food and beverage segment, and average operating margins of food and beverage retailers.\n\nCEO Adolfo Orive and his team keep quarterly business reviews focused on the future (“What do we need to do?”), not the past (“What were our sales in India last quarter?”). When signposts suggest a move toward one scenario over the others, management takes steps to accelerate its existing programs or launch new ones. That has enabled Tetra Pak to adapt its strategy quickly to fundamental shifts in environmental policy and customer preferences. To take just one of many examples at the company, as price elasticity in its largest markets increased far faster than its base forecast—a flashing-red indicator of commoditization—Tetra Pak accelerated its push toward lower-cost packaging. The new model has also made performance monitoring at the company far more action oriented and consequential, resulting in much higher levels of growth and profitability.\n\nAlthough many promising tools have been developed to help cope with uncertainty, most executives struggle in consistently applying them to make better decisions. Winning in uncertain times requires a new model for strategy development. Companies that move quickly to adopt the more dynamic approach we’ve set out will pull ahead—and stay ahead—in the coming decades. Those that stick with their “plan then do” ways risk falling irreparably behind."

Companies can run small experiments to test \"dreamy\" ideas that could become large businesses with strong returns and the potential to endure, and use the results to guide their decision-making.\n4. Identify Trigger Points, Signposts, and Metrics: This step involves identifying key factors that will affect a company's strategy, and developing specific metrics to monitor them. By tracking these metrics, companies can spot changes in the market before their competitors do and take advantage of the flexibility embedded in their strategies.\n5. Provide Prescriptive Surveillance: This step involves shifting the focus of performance monitoring from past performance to future direction. Companies should monitor their performance for signs that a change in course may be necessary, and have contingency plans in place to respond quickly to significant changes in market or competitive conditions."

Collis goes on to say\nThe Incumbent’s Mistake\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms’ activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the “disruptive” innovator?\n\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you’ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn’t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn’t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn’t exist previously.\n\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn’t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\n\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects’ entire costs by well over 15%—creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu’s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\n\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model—that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\n\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix’s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster’s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was “delivering personal video entertainment,” suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider—convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog—reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren’t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it’s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\n\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores. Source: Author analysis, “Netflix in 20 11,” an HBS case study by Willy Shih and Stephen P. Kaufman\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon’s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart’s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon’s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart’s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart’s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon’s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other’s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers."

Collis adds\nThe Entrepreneur’s Mistake\nIn their excitement to exploit new opportunities they spotted before anyone else, many entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they’re likely to face. Netflix has been copied by dozens of credible companies, including Disney, and Casper—the innovator of the bed-in-a-box business model—has 175 competitors. Seduced by their immediate success, entrepreneurs often commit to an investment that never pays a worthwhile return. WhatsApp, for example, now faces numerous free-messaging rivals, but its owner, Facebook, has yet to monetize any of its 2 billion users.\n\nWhen a firm is pursuing a successful new business model against intense competition, it’s vital to apply the three value-capture frameworks in the middle of the landscape—industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction. Consider a business model that investors are now enamored with: electric vehicles. In early April, Tesla had the highest market capitalization of any car company ever and the sixth-highest market cap in the United States (hitting $672 billion on April 12)—more than the combined market caps of Ford, GM, Toyota, Daimler, and Volkswagen. Tesla has certainly identified and exploited an appealing business model, but it’s unclear whether it will ever make a decent return on its investment. Why, if the business model creates so much value for customers? The answer lies in the effect that a promising new business model has on other parts of the strategy landscape.\nTo capture sufficient value, a firm has to be in an industry with an attractive structure and possess a sustainable competitive advantage. Unfortunately, the electric vehicle industry of the future will look remarkably similar to the auto industry of the present. Every carmaker in the world and every company with an interest in electric motors is entering the business. (Even the vacuum cleaner company Dyson invested half a billion dollars in a car design and a plant before realizing the error of its ways.) Given that barriers to entry are low with electric vehicles because of the simplicity of their design and their few (relative to an internal combustion engine) parts, even more companies are likely to jump in. In fact, the quicker the adoption of electric vehicles around the world is, the faster competitors will enter the race and the more rapidly the attractiveness of the industry will deteriorate.\n\nNor is it clear that Tesla has a sustainable competitive advantage. It might have a brand aura and a performance edge today, but its design and engineering expertise will soon be challenged by Porsche and other performance manufacturers, like BMW and Mercedes. Moreover, it’s well behind other auto companies in cumulative production experience and overall scale, so its manufacturing cost position is unenviable. Indeed, the need for scale has led Tesla to add more models—it’s now producing seven—which increases its total output to about 500,000 a year but creates inefficiencies.\n\nTesla also appears to be finding it challenging to realize value through the effective execution of its strategy. The automaker has had enormous quality problems in the United States. (Consumer Reports no longer recommends the Models S and Y.) If you simply cannot achieve operational efficiencies, you are condemned to fail, regardless of how exciting your business model is."

The second is the mistake of entrepreneurs, who are so focused on exploiting new opportunities that they fail to consider the competition they will face.\n\nTo avoid these mistakes, Collis suggests that CEOs should take the following actions: identify opportunities, define the best way to tap those opportunities, figure out how to capture the value generated in the near term, build the capabilities needed to realize value over the long term, and adapt the implementation processes to the changing environment.

        "value": "David J. Collis also adds\nImplementation: The Key to Realizing Value Over Time\nIdentifying a viable business model and a distinctive competitive position that captures value today doesn’t ensure success when companies confront ever-changing opportunities. To realize value over the long term, firms have to balance agility and control, by giving project teams the authority to experiment with new configurations while consistently investing in the capabilities needed for the future.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the challenge for established companies often is not designing a completely new competitive position but supporting entrepreneurial activity that drives incremental but continual improvement. Indeed, most managers’ involvement in strategy today is with projects that adapt operational activities rather than a onetime change-management process to execute a different strategy.\n\nConsider a hamburger chain that is successfully pursuing a low-cost strategy targeted at young men. Mobile technology is the hot topic presenting an opportunity—one that is even bigger now that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused indoor dining to plunge and takeout to soar. The restaurant chain’s desire to capitalize on it unleashes a flood of proposals that would affect nearly every activity in the firm. Do we redesign the menu so that items can be prepared in advance? Should we change the restaurant layout to accommodate a separate pickup point? Do we need to relocate stores in anticipation of new customer traffic patterns?\n\nOften CEOs underestimate how much new technologies and business models can increase the value provided to customers.\n\nIt’s in developing plans to realign the firm’s activities that strategy plays out every day—not in its initial grand design. Tactical though they might appear, these adaptations are fundamentally strategic because they cut across functions inside the firm and require systemic change. Yet too many CEOs give them short shrift.\n\nConversely, entrepreneurs can fail by too frequently adjusting their product-market fit in response to the latest consumer test, which undermines their ability to build the organizational capabilities required for long-term success. Nasty Gal, for example, was an early mover in online fashion retailing but went bankrupt after it pursued too many expansion efforts, overstretching an organization that lacked effective leadership and weakening the attachment customers had to the brand.\n\nThe solution for both established and young companies is a strategic approach that champions experimentation within bounds clearly established by the CEO. Each exploratory project should have a clear, objective process, a timetable, metrics, milestones that trigger cutoff decisions, and after-action reviews. However, CEOs cannot and should not get involved in projects’ minutiae; that would simply be overwhelming.\n\nControl is maintained first through adherence to a well-articulated and well-communicated “classic” strategy that clarifies how the firm will outperform competitors pursuing the same business model. That will set limits that the organization won’t go beyond, helping ensure that any solution a project team proposes will fit within the chosen value proposition, configuration of activities, and business scope. (See “Lean Strategy,” HBR, March 2016.)\n\nHidden in this part of the strategy landscape is a source of competitive advantage that capitalizes on the interdependency of its elements. Strategic adaptation must become an ongoing, iterative process of hypothesis, experimentation, learning, and action. The faster a firm cycles through the process, the more effective it will be in the marketplace. Indeed, as George Stalk Jr. and Sam Stewart of the Boston Consulting Group have noted, the more a firm can compress the cycle time, the stronger an advantage it will possess."

It requires an aligned set of choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success. The entire set of strategic decisions comprises these questions: One: What is our opportunity set? What demographic, political, technological, regulatory, and other environmental changes can we exploit? Two: How can we create the most value? What is our business model? What’s the “job to be done” for customers? How will we charge for our product or service? What assets do we need to produce and deliver it? Three: How can we capture value? Does the industry structure allow a decent return? What is our positioning? What is the scope of our business? What is its competitive advantage—its unique value proposition and distinctive configuration of activities? How will our rivals react? Four: How do we keep realizing value over the long term? Will our initiatives build the capabilities we need in the long term? Are we organized to adapt to change? Five: How strong is the outcome? Does our performance provide us enough resources to support desirable future moves?\nThe second control mechanism lies in selection of the tactical projects pursued. Here, the CEO must be able to see through the fog of immediate pressures and identify and support a limited number of long-term initiatives that will guide the individual experiments. Typically, these become “corporate” initiatives, even if in smaller firms nothing that fancy is ever announced. They’re not objectives, since they lack a time frame and specific metrics, but broad themes that govern the sequence, selection, and design of multiple projects. They must be injected into every ongoing change program in the firm that cuts across silos and boundaries.\n\nThese broad initiatives should be manageable in number—probably seven or fewer—so that each can be adequately funded, monitored, and continually promoted. They cannot change regularly; if that happens, they’ll be viewed as “flavors of the month” that can be ignored or met with lip service.\n\nCEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking?\n\nThese higher-level strategic programs must be owned and championed by the CEO. Only the firm’s top leader has the perspective and authority to ensure there’s enough investment in building the capabilities they’ll require. One example is the “digitalization” initiative at Siemens that Joe Kaeser spearheaded. Another is the Creating the New initiative at Adidas, which Herbert Hainer started and his successor, Kasper Rørsted, is continuing; it focuses on speed (in order to offer consumers “exactly the products they want to buy whenever, wherever, and however they want to buy”), key strategic cities (to spot emerging trends), and open-source innovation (collaborating with third parties in industry, sports, and entertainment). A third example is Bob Iger’s commitment to invest in quality branded franchises, technology, and globalization during his 14 years at the helm of Walt Disney. Each CEO took personal responsibility for shepherding progress in the chosen areas.\n\nIt is the outcome of these “must-win” battles that determines long-run success. Though these broad themes or initiatives are not corporate strategies—as they are often mistakenly called—their pursuit is an essential part of a complete strategy."

Collis continues to say that:\nthe Need for Integration Across the Landscape\nA vivid example of a firm that has integrated its strategy across the complete landscape is Edward Jones, a St. Louis–based brokerage firm I have been advising for 20 years. In 2020, under the leadership of Penny Pennington, it embarked on a plan to increase the value it created for clients. The plan is being implemented in a series of projects that revise many of the firm’s business practices. However, none of them will alter the firm’s current customer scope or competitive positioning: delivering trusted personal guidance to conservative individuals who prefer to delegate their financial decisions to financial advisers located in a national network of offices.\n\nEdward Jones has been performing extraordinarily well, with profitability that’s above average for its industry. It has the most brokers of any firm in North America and nearly $1.5 trillion in assets under management, and it consistently makes Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For list. So why did Pennington and her leadership team decide that it needed to undergo dramatic change?\n\nThe problem is not with the firm’s positioning. The target customers—conservative people who want a trusted adviser to help them manage their money and provide guidance on their financial future—have not gone away. If anything, information overload and increasing time demands have only increased how many consumers (traditionally 23% of the market) value this service. Nor is the firm’s value proposition any less important to those customers: the security and peace of mind that come from knowing your investments are in safe hands.\nThe issue isn’t competitive imitation either. No rival company has been able to replicate the firm’s 17,000 offices throughout North America.\n\nThe problem is that the attractiveness of traditional portfolio management has been eroded by environmental changes: the rise of fintech companies, like Robinhood, with new business models enabled by new technologies; a demographic shift as Baby Boomers begin spending down their accumulated assets; new regulations requiring more attention to smaller accounts; and investor preferences for passive asset management. Those developments, and others, have reduced the perceived value of the services Edward Jones traditionally delivered. Today completing a transaction is free online. Portfolio allocation according to individual risk preferences costs 0.2% when offered by a robo-adviser. Index fund management fees are as low as 0%. As a result, simple portfolio management, while still incredibly useful for customers, doesn’t provide enough value to allow brokers like Edward Jones to prosper."

        "value": "David J. Collis goes on to say that the challenge for Edward Jones is to create more value for its customers and capture that value through new business models. To do this, the firm has to develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of new business models and determining whether to pursue them. This involves looking at the opportunities presented by new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and the potential impact on the industry structure and the firm's competitive advantage.\n\nPennington and her team have identified a number of areas where the firm can create more value for its customers, such as providing more personalized financial advice, offering broader financial planning services, and leveraging data and analytics to help customers make better financial decisions. These initiatives will require the firm to invest in new capabilities, such as developing its digital capabilities and building a stronger data analytics capability.\n\nThe key to realizing value over time is to balance agility and control. This means giving project teams the authority to experiment with new configurations, while consistently investing in the capabilities needed for the future. It also means applying the three value-capture frameworks in the middle of the strategy landscape - industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction - to ensure that the firm is in an industry with an attractive structure and has a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the complete strategy landscape involves more than just finding an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. It requires an aligned set of choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success. By integrating across the entire strategy landscape, firms can create more value for their customers and capture that value through new business models, ensuring their long-term success."

        "value": "David J. Collis concludes:\nThe solution is not to alter the company’s competitive position. If Edward Jones changed its customer scope by serving day traders, it would be positioned in the most price-competitive part of the market. If it altered its model of entrepreneurial advisers who are embedded in communities, it would lose its cooperative, client-interests-first culture. The best hope for escaping commoditization is to pursue business model innovation that creates more value and potentially monetizes it in ways other than just a commission on each transaction.\n\nEdward Jones is therefore following the path that other professional services firms have taken and is shifting from a product, or “transactional,” business model to a financial life “solutions” business model. Through a five-step process that begins with documenting individual goals, the firm now offers customized advice and solutions for lifelong needs, not just purchases of mutual funds or blue-chip stocks. Though this approach requires more-intense engagement with customers, it creates substantially more value for them.\n\nMany entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they’re likely to face.\n\nIn its efforts to successfully shift to the financial life solutions model, Edward Jones has identified must-win battles in several areas, including diversity (while about half of Generation Z is nonwhite, fewer than 15% of the firm’s advisers belong to minority groups); intergenerational wealth transfer (an estimated $40 trillion in assets will be inherited by Millennials); and multichannel distribution (to effectively serve a full range of clients regardless of net worth and to complement in-person services with digital interactions). The firm has created teams, each of which works on part of a broader initiative—for instance, how to enter urban markets with a large minority population—to develop and test approaches addressing those challenges. Specific projects will come and go over time, but the focus on building capabilities required for long-term success will remain.\n\nNotice that we need to look at the whole strategy landscape to understand the change under way at Edward Jones. First, new developments (in demographics, regulation, capital markets’ performance, and so on) are throwing up novel threats and opportunities. Second, the reduction in value capture for the industry is undermining the old business model. Third, the business model itself now needs to be retooled to create more value even if the competitive positioning is unchanged. And fourth, the revisions will take place through projects that support broader strategic initiatives.\n\nThe most important lesson is that to craft a resilient strategy, companies of all sizes must integrate all the elements of the complete strategy landscape. While not disregarding how critical competitive positioning is to value capture, an effective strategy process must begin with a creative and open-ended discussion of the value potential of alternative business models and finish with an approach to execution that guides ongoing experimentation and operational adaptation while investing in underlying capabilities.\n\nStrategy has always been about aligning the organization behind a clear direction. Today it must be broadened to become an integrated set of choices about the business model, competitive positioning, and capabilities required for long-term success. By managing the complete strategy landscape, CEOs of young ventures will greatly increase the odds that their firms won’t crash and burn, and leaders of established companies will ensure that they continually renew themselves."

The album’s title refers to the “aubade”, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a “fruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.” Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\ncredits\nreleased February 4, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\nMKX\\_300dpi\n\n \n\nCerys Weetch\n\nLabel / A&R Manager\n\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\n\nwww.mercurykx.com\n\n---"

Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Saëns' left hand études religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n\n\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n\n\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's études - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate études to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire étude for left hand solo.\n\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n\n\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n\n\n7. Diversions - Britten\n\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n\n\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n\n9. Six études for the left hand - Saint-Saëns\n\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Saëns' piano études are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano."

English pop singer Ellie Goulding has cited Blais as an inspiration for her fourth album.[1]\n\nHis debut studio album Il was released in April 2016 on Arts & Crafts, garnering critical acclaim, including making Time magazine's top ten albums of the year list.[2] In 2017, he collaborated with Grammy-nominated English-Canadian electronic artist CFCF on the EP Cascades. His sophomore album, Dans ma main, was released on 11 May 2018, also on Arts & Crafts, and on 30 November 2018 Jean-Michel released Eviction Sessions.\nContents\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n2.1 2016: Il\n2.2 2017: Cascades\n2.3 2018: Dans ma main\n2.4 Eviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\nEarly life\nJean-Michel Blais grew up in the rural town of Nicolet, Quebec.[3] As a young boy, his parents influenced his love of music. While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a child, and his mother would play the organ.[4] Blais began his musical adventures by \"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio-Canada \"world\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\".[3]\n\nAs a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivières Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel.[4]\n\nHe travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage.[4] Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher.[5] He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level.\n\nCareer\n2016: Il\nWhile working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording.[4]\n\nIf people are going to cough and babies are going to cry, instead of trying to hide it, why not embrace it? I like it when I stop and there's something happening outside my window. I think that's why my music has a lot of pauses and silences, because there's always something happening in the street. I'll let it pass and then continue playing.\n\n— Jean-Michel Blais in an interview with the Montreal Gazette[6]\nBlais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music.[7] Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on 8 April 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016.[8] The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine's Top 10 Albums of 2016.[2] Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\"[9]\n\n2017: Cascades\nMichael Silver (a.k.a. CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style.[10] Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage's In a Landscape (1948).\nI thought [Jean-Michel's music] was beautiful... I just loved it a bunch, especially because it's so different from a lot of the other piano music that I had tended to listen to...\n\n— Michael Silver (CFCF)\nCascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end,\" and called the duo's version of \"In a Landscape\", \"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\".[11] Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver's chemistry, reasoning that \"Blais' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\" giving the album an 8/10.[12]\n\n2018: Dans ma main\nDans ma main is Blais' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on 11 May 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\".[13] On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF.\n\nBlais explained in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\".[14] The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[15] In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main.[16]\n\nEviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\nEviction Sessions is Blais' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on 30 November 2018. Eviction Sessions was inspired when Blais was informed he would be evicted from the apartment where he had lived for seven years due to gentrification within his Montreal neighbourhood. This was the same apartment in which Blais recorded his first album of instrumental music, Il. [1]\n\nIn October 2019, Blais released the soundtrack to the Canadian film Matthias & Maxime. He received special mention at the Cannes Soundtrack Award in May of the same year.[17]\n\nIn February 2022, Blais released the album Aubades.[18] The album won the Félix Award for Instrumental Album of the Year at the 44th Félix Awards; it was also nominated for Bestselling Album of the Year, and Blais was a nominee for Most Successful Artist Outside Quebec.[19]\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\nIl (2016)\nDans ma main (2018)\nAubades (2022)\nSoundtracks\n\nMatthias & Maxime (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (2019)\nEPs\n\nCascades with CFCF (2017)\nEviction Sessions (2018)\nDans ma main (Remixes) (2019)[20]\nSingles\n\n\"Nostos\" (2016)\n\"il\" (2016)\n\"roses\" (2018)\n\"blind\" (2018)\n\"forteresse\" (2018)\n\"outsiders\" (2018)\nAppearances\n\n\"Lullaby\" Playing House (Common Holly, 2017)"

The visuals shift feverishly between the young man’s grey, urban reality and his decadent Baroque fantasy world.\n\n“Inspired by Debussy, I wanted to see how a passepied would work today,” says Blais, whose latest album, aubades, sees the musician transition from pianist to composer for the first time. “Using this historic dance form, which originated in Brittany and then was popularized in Baroque courts, I wanted to declassify classical music—democratize it for new listeners. Adrian's docufiction represents this swing of the pendulum, making classical music accessible again to the modern viewer and listener.”\n\n“This reflects my own journey, a country boy traveling back in time to something seemingly uncool”\n\nPassepied is a well-choreographed visual extension of Blais’ contrapuntal orchestration. Villagomez reflects the sprightly conversations between the piano, strings and woodwind in the friction that grows between the young man and his friend—focussing on a growing delirium that moves in rubato with the music.\n\n“I chose a hip hop dancer to perform this classical dance of which he had no familiarity,” says the director. “This creates an interesting ambiguity when you watch him execute the dance. Our actor had the will to learn the steps to perfection. It works very well with the direction of the story: to escape his daily reality through an odd and unexpected new passion.\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\nBehind the scenes photos by Karel Chladek\n\n“The documentary process ensured that we were able to develop the scenario according to what presented itself to us; new encounters along the way as well as the social and personal context of each of our two actors.”\n\nThis dance film is as much about self-discovery as it is about self-expression. Blais wrote this album of uplifting neoclassical serenades during the pandemic and after a breakup. His willingness to take a new direction in his music, to venture into uncharted territory, marries well with the Passepied actor who throws himself wholeheartedly into learning a new style of dance. If this project ever had a didactic edge, it would be to seek out new encounters, even if it takes you to uncommon places.\n\n“This reflects my own journey, a country boy traveling back in time through something seemingly “uncool” and as old-fashioned as classical music. The perfect analogy to anyone's odd dream to be pursued without getting caught into it.”"

Continuing the story of the ballet instructor from his previous release ‘passepied’ this offering, created by collaborator Adrian Villagomez, spotlights Russian ballerina Larissa Belova in a melancholic and inspiring dance as a middle-aged woman in the grand empty Théâtre Outremont in Montréal. In docufilm style, it switches between VHS footage of Larissa’s past performance as a young ballerina and behind-the-scenes footage and her choreographed performance today exploring memory, loss and love of dance.\n\nDirector, Adrian Villagomez says, “It's while working on Passepied that we got to know Larissa, Vlad's mother, who turned out to be a very interesting character, and that's when we realized that she alone could have been the protagonist of a feature film.”\n\n“I always wanted to mix the documentary style with music videos. Larissa is a strong and endearing character, she certainly has 100 stories to tell and is 'extremely generous with her person. We felt privileged to have this closeness with her and give her the chance to perform with all the greatness she deserves. What's cool about Jean-Michel is that when we start with a strong concept, we allow ourselves to let it evolve along the way. I think that's why we can say we have a true documentary approach by letting ourselves rewrite the story during the filming as well as during post-production.”\n\nJean-Michel adds, “when approached to dance for 'amour', Larissa responded with an additional choreography for 'ouessant' ! We then had no choice but to write this docu-fiction, incorporating her glorious past as a Soviet ballerina with her current grace as a woman, a loving mother, a generous, sensitive and explosive artist. 'amour / ouessant' is therefore both a process and a product, a testimony and a continuity, a creation and an inspiration for those who forgot their dreams along the way ...\""

Recorded at night in a Steinway & Sons piano shop, Blais blends his classical skill and precise pop sensibility with synthetic accompaniment, which creates unique environments where the piano's intimacy can be subtly disrupted at any time. Released in May 2018, Dans ma main earned a Polaris Music Prize shortlist nomination and a Libera nomination.\n\nBlais will release the soundtrack to Canadian director Xavier Dolan's upcoming film release, 'Matthias & Maxime', on Mercury KX.

This includes the related entities that are associated with the entity being persisted, updated, or removed through the entity's relationships, such as @OneToMany, @OneToOne, @ManyToMany, etc.\n\nFor example, let's consider an `Order` entity that has a one-to-many relationship with `OrderItem` entities. If the `CascadeType.ALL` option is specified on the `Order` entity's `@OneToMany` annotation, then when an `Order` entity is persisted or removed, JPA will automatically persist or remove all the associated `OrderItem` entities as well.\n\nNote that using `CascadeType.ALL` can have some important implications on the performance and behavior of the application, as well as the consistency and integrity of the database.

Your task is to provide a concise summary of the main ideas, definitions of important terms, and analysis in bullet format with corresponding subheadings. Please include an analysis section under the summary with its own subheading. Your summary should be informative and provide a clear understanding of the text's content. Please do not include any personal opinion or irrelevant information. Your first task is to perform the above on the following text \" Absence Impedes Communication\n\nA manager often creates communication problems by not being reasonably accessible. When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\n\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees’ direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner. In most instances, a first-line manager is a worker as well as a manager. These supervisory responsibilities provide an additional resource for a department. When a manager is unavailable, a potentially productive resource is lost.\""

        "value": "\"A Genuine Open Door: Attitude and Actuality\n\nManagers may occasionally use phrases often cynically described as coming from “Management 101.” However, words alone are not sufficient; managers must back up the words with actions. Few managers have not said, “My door is always open.” Unless the door is, in fact, usually open, employees quickly perceive reality. Few supervisors or managers are able to maintain a truly open-door policy. Supervisors are usually busy people, especially in times of shrinking managerial hierarchies and expanding responsibilities for individual managers. Contemporary managers must wrestle with problems, attend seemingly endless meetings, make and take telephone calls, and generally engage in many time-consuming activities. The effect of these responsibilities is that it is nearly impossible for a manager to sit behind a desk always available for any employee to drop in at any time.\n\nSome managers are not easily accessible at any time because they are genuinely busy. Even though a manager has said, “My door is always open,” the manager’s attitude says, “The door may stand open, but I dislike interruptions and you should not consider entering without an appointment.” The reality of an open-door policy depends largely on a manager’s attitude. Even managers who are generally visible and available to their employees most of the time can discourage contact by projecting an attitude that discourages employees from approaching.\""

Identify the crank, connecting rod, and load of the mechanism, and draw a diagram to represent the mechanism. In this case, the crank is rotating at 300 radians per second and has a length of 50 mm, the connecting rod has a length of 170 mm, and the angle between the crank and the connecting rod is 60 degrees.\n2. Calculate the velocity of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the law of cosines to find the length of the connecting rod and the angle between the connecting rod and the horizontal. Then, use the formula for velocity (v = r x w, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the velocity of the connecting rod and the load.\n3. Calculate the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the formula for acceleration (a = r x w^2, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load.\n4. Draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use arrows to represent the velocity and acceleration of the crank, the connecting rod, and the load. Make sure to label each arrow with the corresponding velocity or acceleration value.\n5. Use the velocity and acceleration diagrams to determine the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use the values you calculated in steps 2 and 3, and apply the appropriate formulas (e.g. linear acceleration = tangential acceleration / radius) to find the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism.\n\nRemember, the key to drawing velocity and acceleration diagrams is to carefully calculate the velocity and acceleration of each part of the mechanism, and to use arrows to represent these values in your diagrams. By following these steps, you should be able to accurately draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for a crank mechanism."

So, `mapping(address => bool)` means that the `alreadyCalled` mapping will associate each Ethereum address with a boolean value.\n\nThe `public` keyword in this line of code means that the `alreadyCalled` mapping can be accessed by anyone who interacts with the contract.\n\n1. `require(!alreadyCalled[msg.sender], \"You have already called splitDAO\");`\n\nIn Solidity, `require` is a keyword that checks a condition and throws an error if the condition is not met. In this line of code, we are checking to see if the `alreadyCalled` mapping for the calling address (`msg.sender`) is false. If it is true, then we throw an error message saying \"You have already called splitDAO\".\n\nThe `!` symbol before `alreadyCalled[msg.sender]` is a logical negation operator. It returns `true` if the value of `alreadyCalled[msg.sender]` is `false`, and `false` if the value of `alreadyCalled[msg.sender]` is `true`.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the `mapping` and `require` keywords in this Solidity code are used to prevent a caller from executing the `splitDAO` function more than once per transaction. The `mapping` associates each caller's Ethereum address with a boolean value that tracks whether they have already called the function. The `require` statement checks this value and throws an error if the caller has already called the function."

        "value": "The Garmin Fenix 5 and Apple Watch Series 4 are both popular choices for runners, but they have some differences that might make one more suitable for you depending on your preferences and needs. Here's a comparison of running-related features for the Garmin Fenix 5 and Apple Watch Series 4:\n\n1. GPS Accuracy and Performance:\nGarmin Fenix 5: Garmin watches are well-known for their GPS accuracy, and the Fenix 5 is no exception. It uses both GPS and GLONASS satellite systems for accurate tracking during your runs. The watch also allows you to customize GPS settings, such as choosing between GPS-only mode, GPS+GLONASS, or UltraTrac mode, which extends battery life by reducing GPS sampling rate.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 also offers GPS tracking, utilizing GPS and GLONASS satellite systems. The GPS performance is generally accurate, but some users have reported occasional inconsistencies in distance tracking compared to dedicated running watches like the Garmin.\n\n1. Heart Rate Monitoring:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 includes an optical heart rate sensor, which is reasonably accurate for most activities, including running. However, for maximum accuracy, you can also pair the watch with a chest strap heart rate monitor.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 has an optical heart rate sensor as well, which is known for being accurate during running activities. It also includes electrical heart rate sensors that enable ECG functionality, although this feature is not specifically related to running.\n\n1. Running Metrics and Features:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 provides advanced running metrics like cadence, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, and more when paired with compatible accessories like the Garmin HRM-Run or HRM-Tri heart rate monitors. Additionally, the watch offers customizable data screens, interval training, and virtual pacer, among other features.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 offers basic running metrics such as distance, pace, and heart rate but lacks some advanced metrics like vertical oscillation and ground contact time. It supports interval training and offers guided workouts through third-party apps like Nike+ Run Club.\n\n1. Battery Life:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 offers an impressive battery life of up to 2 weeks in smartwatch mode, 24 hours in GPS mode, and up to 60 hours in UltraTrac mode. This extended battery life is particularly useful for long runs, ultramarathons, or multi-day events.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 has a battery life of up to 18 hours, including about 4-6 hours of continuous GPS usage. This battery life is adequate for most runners, but may not be enough for ultra-distance events or multi-day activities.\n\nIn summary, the Garmin Fenix 5 is geared more towards serious runners and outdoor enthusiasts who need advanced running metrics, customization, and longer battery life. The Apple Watch Series 4 is more suitable for casual runners and those looking for a smartwatch with additional non-fitness features. Both watches provide accurate GPS and heart rate tracking, but the Garmin Fenix 5 has an edge when it comes to advanced running features and battery life."

        "value": "Sleep tracking is an important feature for many users who want to monitor and improve their sleep quality. Both the Garmin Fenix 5 and Apple Watch Series 4 provide sleep tracking capabilities, but with varying degrees of accuracy and depth of data.\n\nGarmin Fenix 5:\nThe Garmin Fenix 5 utilizes its built-in accelerometer and heart rate monitor to track sleep. It automatically detects when you fall asleep and wake up, and provides information on sleep duration, sleep stages (light, deep, and REM), and periods of movement or wakefulness during the night. Garmin's sleep tracking is generally considered to be accurate, but it may not always perfectly detect sleep and wake times. For more in-depth sleep analysis, you can sync your data with the Garmin Connect app, which provides additional insights and trends over time.\n\nApple Watch Series 4:\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 does not have a native sleep tracking feature built-in, but you can use third-party apps like AutoSleep, Sleep Watch, or Pillow to monitor your sleep. These apps use the watch's accelerometer and heart rate data to track sleep duration, quality, and stages. The accuracy of sleep tracking on the Apple Watch Series 4 depends on the specific app used, but it's generally considered to be reliable for tracking sleep duration and quality. However, it may not be as precise as dedicated sleep trackers or other fitness wearables with built-in sleep tracking features.\n\nIn summary, the Garmin Fenix 5 offers built-in sleep tracking with reasonably accurate sleep stage analysis, while the Apple Watch Series 4 relies on third-party apps for sleep tracking capabilities. The accuracy of sleep tracking on both devices is generally reliable, but it may not be as precise as dedicated sleep trackers or other wearables with more advanced sleep monitoring features. If sleep tracking is a priority for you, the Garmin Fenix 5 might be a better choice due to its built-in sleep tracking and sleep stage analysis."

Because decentralized identifiers are based on blockchain technology, they are theoretically secure and difficult to forge. However, blockchain technology is still relatively new and untested at a large scale, so there may be security vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the system means that there is no central authority overseeing the issuance and management of digital identities, which could make it easier for individuals to create fake or fraudulent identities. Finally, the use of Ethereum as the underlying blockchain platform for the system introduces additional risks, such as the potential for smart contract vulnerabilities and the risks associated with the volatile nature of cryptocurrency."

An example of a module with high cohesion might be a module that performs a specific mathematical calculation, where all of the functions and variables within that module are related to that calculation.\n\nOn the other hand, coupling refers to the degree to which different modules or components of a software system depend on each other. A system with high coupling has many interdependent modules, while a system with low coupling has modules that are independent and can be changed or modified without affecting the rest of the system. An example of a module with low coupling might be a module that displays information to the user, which can be modified or changed without affecting other parts of the system.\n\nIt is generally considered good software design practice to aim for high cohesion and low coupling in a software system.

The SOLID principles are:\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks.\n\nHere's an example of a class that violates the Single Responsibility Principle:\n```\nclass Employee {\n  private String name;\n  private String jobTitle;\n  private int salary;\n\n  public Employee(String name, String jobTitle, int salary) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.jobTitle = jobTitle;\n    this.salary = salary;\n  }\n\n  public String getName() {\n    return name;\n  }\n\n  public String getJobTitle() {\n    return jobTitle;\n  }\n\n  public int getSalary() {\n    return salary;\n  }\n\n  public void saveToDatabase() {\n    // code to save employee to database\n  }\n\n  public void sendEmail() {\n    // code to send email\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `Employee` class is responsible for storing employee data and saving it to a database, as well as sending emails. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, as the class has two distinct responsibilities.\n\nA better design would be to separate these responsibilities into two separate classes: one for storing and saving employee data, and another for sending emails.\n\n1. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that it can be extended to add new functionality without modifying the existing code.\n\nHere's an example of a class that violates the Open/Closed Principle:\n```\nclass Rectangle {\n  private int width;\n  private int height;\n\n  public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n  }\n\n  public int getArea() {\n    return width * height;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Circle {\n  private int radius;\n\n  public Circle(int radius) {\n    this.radius = radius;\n  }\n\n  public int getArea() {\n    return (int) (Math.PI * radius * radius);\n  }\n}\n\nclass ShapeCalculator {\n  public int calculateArea(Object shape) {\n    if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {\n      Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;\n      return rectangle.getArea();\n    } else if (shape instanceof Circle) {\n      Circle circle = (Circle) shape;\n      return circle.getArea();\n    } else {\n      throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `ShapeCalculator` class calculates the area of different shapes by using an `if` statement to check the type of the shape. If a new shape is added to the system, the `ShapeCalculator` class would need to be modified to include code to handle the new shape, which violates the Open/Closed Principle.\n\nA better design would be to define an interface for shapes, with a method for calculating the area, and have each shape implement the interface:\n\n``"

This violates the Interface Segregation Principle, since the `Triangle` and `Square` classes are forced to implement methods that they do not need.\n\nA better design would be to define separate interfaces for each group of related methods, such as `Drawable`, `Resizable`, and `Colorable`. The `Triangle`, `Square`, and `Circle` classes can then implement only the interfaces that are relevant to their specific needs, rather than being forced to implement a larger, more generic interface.

It is the apparent contradiction between the high probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations. The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who was discussing the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations with colleagues, when he posed the question, \"Where is everybody?\"\n\nThe paradox arises from a combination of several factors. The first is the assumption that the universe is vast and contains many stars similar to the Sun. Many of these stars are likely to have planets in their habitable zones, where conditions are suitable for life as we know it to exist. The second factor is the assumption that life is a relatively common occurrence in the universe. This assumption is based on the fact that life arose on Earth relatively quickly after the planet formed and that the building blocks of life are abundant in the universe.\n\nThe third factor is the assumption that at least some civilizations will develop technology that allows them to communicate over interstellar distances. This assumption is based on the rapid progress of technology on Earth and the likelihood that at least some civilizations will be able to survive long enough to develop such technology.\n\nBased on these assumptions, it would seem likely that there should be many extraterrestrial civilizations in the universe that we should be able to detect. However, despite decades of searching, we have found no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations. This lack of evidence is the Fermi Paradox.\n\nMany solutions have been proposed to explain the Fermi Paradox, but no single explanation has been widely accepted. Some popular solutions include the possibility that civilizations may not be able to communicate with each other, that they are avoiding contact with Earth, that civilizations may be rare in the universe, or that the universe is too vast for us to detect extraterrestrial civilizations. The Fermi Paradox remains an open question in the field of SETI and astrobiology."

        "value": "The Fermi Paradox is often used to explain the lack of evidence for other advanced civilizations in the universe. There are several possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox that attempt to explain why we have not yet found any evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the high probability of their existence. Some of these explanations include:\n\n* The Great Filter: The Great Filter hypothesis suggests that there is a barrier or a set of barriers that prevent civilizations from becoming advanced and long-lived. The Great Filter could be located at any stage in the development of a civilization, such as the origin of life, the development of intelligence, or the development of technology that allows for interstellar communication.\n* The Rare Earth Hypothesis: This hypothesis suggests that the conditions that allowed for the evolution of intelligent life on Earth are so rare in the universe that the probability of intelligent life existing elsewhere is very low.\n* The Solitude Hypothesis: The Solitude Hypothesis proposes that advanced civilizations are very rare in the universe and that Earth is the only one in our galaxy.\n* The Zoo Hypothesis: According to this hypothesis, advanced civilizations in the universe are aware of Earth and are actively avoiding contact with us. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as fear of contamination of our primitive society or simply not having any interest in us.\n* The Technological Singularity: This hypothesis proposes that advanced civilizations inevitably reach a point where their technology becomes so advanced that it is beyond our understanding and we are no longer able to detect them.\n\nIt should be noted that the Fermi Paradox is still an open question and there is no single explanation that has been widely accepted. However, the possible explanations mentioned above can provide insight into the potential reasons for the lack of evidence of other advanced civilizations in the universe."

        "value": "If our opponent denies the reality of climate change and refuses to accept the environmental benefits of green energy, we could still argue against the claim that alternative energy sources cost more than traditional oil and gas using economic arguments alone.\n\nFirstly, it's worth noting that the cost of renewable energy sources has been steadily decreasing over time, making them increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels. In fact, renewable energy is often cheaper than fossil fuels when you consider the full lifecycle costs, including extraction, transportation, and environmental damage caused by burning fossil fuels.\n\nSecondly, while the upfront costs of renewable energy systems may be higher, they can offer significant long-term cost savings. For example, solar panels and wind turbines have very low operating costs once installed, and their maintenance requirements are minimal compared to traditional power plants that rely on fossil fuels. Over time, the savings from reduced operating and maintenance costs can outweigh the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nThirdly, investing in renewable energy can have positive economic benefits, creating new jobs and driving innovation. Renewable energy industries are rapidly growing and creating new employment opportunities in many regions, particularly in rural areas where traditional industries may be in decline. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, we can also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase energy security, which can be an important economic and national security consideration.\n\nFinally, it's worth considering the economic risks associated with relying solely on traditional fossil fuels. The price of oil and gas can be volatile and subject to sudden price shocks due to geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, or changes in demand. By diversifying our energy sources and investing in renewable energy, we can reduce our exposure to these risks and create a more stable and resilient energy system that is better equipped to handle unexpected disruptions."

        "value": "Sure, here are some further expansions on the economic arguments for renewable energy:\n\n1. Diversification of energy sources: Relying solely on traditional oil and gas sources for energy can be a risky strategy for any country. The global oil and gas market can be volatile, with prices subject to fluctuations due to geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, or changes in demand. Renewable energy sources can provide a stable and predictable source of energy that is not subject to these same risks. By investing in renewable energy, countries can diversify their energy sources and reduce their exposure to potential price shocks and supply disruptions.\n2. Long-term cost savings: While the upfront costs of renewable energy systems may be higher than those of traditional fossil fuels, renewable energy can offer significant long-term cost savings. For example, solar panels and wind turbines have very low operating costs once installed, and their maintenance requirements are minimal compared to traditional power plants that rely on fossil fuels. Over time, the savings from reduced operating and maintenance costs can outweigh the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure.\n3. Job creation and economic growth: Renewable energy industries are rapidly growing and creating new employment opportunities in many regions, particularly in rural areas where traditional industries may be in decline. In addition, investing in renewable energy can help to drive innovation and technological advancements, creating new business opportunities and boosting economic growth.\n4. Energy security: Dependence on foreign oil and gas can be a significant economic and national security concern for many countries. By investing in renewable energy sources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and increase their energy security. This can help to insulate economies from sudden price shocks or supply disruptions that can result from changes in global oil and gas markets.\n5. Public health: Burning fossil fuels can have significant negative impacts on public health, including respiratory problems and other health issues associated with air pollution. Investing in renewable energy can help to reduce these negative impacts, improving public health and reducing healthcare costs."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "If our opponent does not accept the link between fossil fuel burning and air pollution, we can still argue for the economic benefits of transitioning to green energy using the following arguments:\n\n1. Reduced energy costs: While the upfront investment in renewable energy infrastructure may be higher, renewable energy sources can offer significant cost savings over time. For example, once installed, solar panels and wind turbines have very low operating costs and require minimal maintenance. This means that the cost of producing electricity from renewable energy sources can be significantly lower than that of traditional fossil fuels over the long term.\n2. Reduced energy waste: The use of renewable energy sources can help to reduce energy waste by improving the efficiency of energy production and consumption. For example, smart grids that incorporate renewable energy sources can more efficiently distribute energy, reducing the amount of energy lost during transmission. Additionally, many renewable energy technologies, such as LED lights and energy-efficient appliances, require less energy to operate than their traditional counterparts, further reducing energy waste.\n3. Increased economic competitiveness: As renewable energy technology continues to advance and costs continue to decrease, countries that invest in renewable energy sources can become more economically competitive. By reducing their dependence on imported fossil fuels, countries can insulate themselves from the risks associated with global oil and gas markets, such as price volatility and supply disruptions. In addition, renewable energy industries are rapidly growing and creating new employment opportunities in many regions, driving economic growth and job creation.\n4. Improved energy security: Dependence on imported fossil fuels can be a significant economic and national security concern for many countries. By investing in renewable energy sources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and increase their energy security. This can help to insulate economies from sudden price shocks or supply disruptions that can result from changes in global oil and gas markets.\n5. Corporate social responsibility: Many companies are recognizing the importance of corporate social responsibility and are investing in renewable energy sources as part of their sustainability strategies. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, companies can reduce their carbon footprints and demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability. This can have positive impacts on brand image, customer loyalty, and employee morale, among other benefits."

Therefore, we can say that (1 + re) \\* (1 + G) > (1 + rf) \\* (1 + G) or (1 + re) \\* (1 + G) \\* pg(-1) > (1 + rf) \\* (1 + G) \\* pf(-1).\n\nAssuming that the prices of green and fossil energy in the previous period are positive, we can say that the prices of green and fossil energy will continue to increase over time.\n\nFinally, let's look at the equations for the investments in green and fossil energy:\n\nIg = ag \\* (1 - delta) \\* (1 + G) \\* Ig(-1) / pg\nIf = af \\* (1 - deltaf) \\* (1 + G) \\* If(-1) / pf\n\nWe know that ag > af, so Ig will grow faster than If over time. As long as the investments are positive and the prices of energy are increasing, the production of green energy will increase faster than the production of fossil energy.\n\nBased on these equations, we can conclude that our economy will not reach a stable point. The growth rates for green and fossil energy and the other sectors in the economy will continue to increase over time, as will the prices of green and fossil energy. However, the growth rate of green energy will be greater than the growth rate of fossil energy, so green energy will become a larger part of the energy mix over time."

Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$C\\_{f,t} = \\epsilon\\_f \\frac{P\\_{f,t}}{P\\_{r,t}} \\frac{Y\\_{r,t}}{P\\_{f,t}+P\\_{g,t}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}*{\\left{e^{\\eta*{f,t}} K\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{kf}} E\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{ef}} \\geq \\epsilon\\_f \\frac{P\\_{f,t}}{P\\_{r,t}} \\frac{Y\\_{r,t}}{P\\_{f,t}+P\\_{g,t}}\\right}} + e^{\\eta\\_{f,t}} K\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{kf}} E\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{ef}} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}*{\\left{e^{\\eta*{f,t}} K\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{kf}} E\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{ef}} < \\epsilon\\_f \\frac{P\\_{f,t}}{P\\_{r,t}} \\frac{Y\\_{r,t}}{P\\_{f,t}+P\\_{g,t}}\\right}}$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{1}\\_{{A}}$ is the indicator function that takes the value 1 if the statement $A$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\nUsing the same logic, we can write the green energy consumption as:"

It's essential to track your carb intake carefully and make sure that you're not going over your daily limit.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to eat lower-carb fruits like berries, avocados, and tomatoes, which are better suited for a keto diet.

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "To create a JSON Web Token (JWT) login system in a Flask REST API, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Install the Flask-JWT library using `pip install Flask-JWT`.\n2. Import the `JWTManager` class from the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of it.\n3. Define a user model with the necessary fields for authentication, such as a username and password. You can use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define the model.\n4. Create a route for logging in and authenticating a user. In this route, you can verify the user's credentials and create a JWT token if they are valid.\n5. Use the `jwt_manager` instance to encode the JWT token with the user's information and return it to the user.\n6. Create a route for protected resources that require authentication. In this route, use the `jwt_required` decorator provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to protect the route.\n7. In the protected route, use the `get_jwt_identity` function provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to get the user's information from the JWT token.\n8. To store invalid tokens, you can create a model in Flask-SQLAlchemy to hold the token and its expiration time. Then, when a user attempts to access a protected resource with an invalid token, you can add the token to this model to prevent them from using it again.\n\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented in Flask:\n```\n# Import the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of the JWTManager\nfrom flask_jwt import JWTManager\njwt_manager = JWTManager()\n\n# Define the user model with Flask-SQLAlchemy\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)\n\n# Set up the Flask app and initialize Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-JWT\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'SECRET_KEY'\ndb.init_app(app)\njwt_manager.init_app(app)\n\n# Define a login route that authenticates the user and returns a JWT token\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\ndef login():\n    username = request.json.get('username')\n    password = request.json.get('password')\n\n    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()\n\n    if user and user.password == password:\n        token = jwt_manager.encode({'id': user.id, 'username': user.username})\n        return jsonify({'token': token})\n    else:\n        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\n\n# Define a model for storing invalid tokens\nclass InvalidToken(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    token = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    expiration = db.Column(\n```"

To do this, you will need to install the `bcrypt` library using `pip install bcrypt` and import the `bcrypt` module.\n\nHere is an example of how to modify the login route to use bcrypt to hash and verify the password:\n```\n# Import the bcrypt module\nimport bcrypt\n\n# Define a login route that authenticates the user and returns a JWT token\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\ndef login():\n    username = request.json.get('username')\n    password = request.json.get('password')\n\n    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()\n\n    # Hash the password provided by the user with bcrypt\n    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())\n\n    if user and bcrypt.checkpw(user.password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password):\n        token = jwt_manager.encode({'id': user.id, 'username': user.username})\n        return jsonify({'token': token})\n    else:\n        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\n```\nIn this example, the `bcrypt.hashpw` function is used to hash the password provided by the user, and the `bcrypt.checkpw` function is used to verify that the hashed password matches the password stored in the user model. Bcrypt is a more secure hashing algorithm than SHA1 and should be used for password hashing in production systems."

Here is an updated version of the code that includes these measurements:\n```\nimport ij.*;\nimport ij.process.*;\nimport ij.gui.*;\nimport ij.measure.*;\n\npublic class Measure_Holes implements PlugIn {\n\n  public void run(String arg) {\n    // open the current image\n    ImagePlus imp = IJ.getImage();\n    // get the ImageProcessor for the current image\n    ImageProcessor ip = imp.getProcessor();\n\n    // create a binary version of the image\n    // with the threshold value set to 0.5\n    ip.threshold(0.5);\n\n    // create a new ImagePlus object from the\n    // binary image\n    ImagePlus binaryImp = new ImagePlus(\"Binary Image\", ip);\n\n    // create a ParticleAnalyzer object\n    ParticleAnalyzer pa = new ParticleAnalyzer();\n\n    // create an array of Measurements to specify\n    // which measurements we want to compute\n    int measurements = Measurements.FERET | Measurements.MIN_FERET | Measurements.MAX_FERET | Measurements.MEAN_FERET;\n\n    // create a ResultsTable to store the measurement results\n    ResultsTable rt = new ResultsTable();\n\n    // run the ParticleAnalyzer to measure the particles\n    pa.analyze(binaryImp, ip, rt, measurements, rt.getCounter());\n\n    // print the results to the console\n    IJ.log(rt.toString());\n\n    // show the results in a window\n    rt.show(\"Results\");\n  }\n\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `Measurements.MIN_FERET`, `Measurements.MAX_FERET`, and `Measurements.MEAN_FERET` constants to compute the minimum, maximum, and average Feret diameters of the particles in the image. The results of these measurements will be shown in the `Results` window. You can also access these values programmatically by calling the `getValue()` method of the `ResultsTable` object, passing in the appropriate column name as an argument. For example, to get the minimum Feret diameter, you would use the following code:\n```\ndouble minFeretDiameter = rt.getValue(\"MinFeret\", 0);\n```\nThis code gets the value in the `\"MinFeret\"` column of the first row of the results table (the `0` index indicates the first row). You can use a similar approach to get the other diameter measurements.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

For example:\n```\njavac Measure_Holes.java\n```\nThis will create a `Measure_Holes.class` file in the same directory.\n3. Copy the `Measure_Holes.class` file to the `plugins` directory of your ImageJ installation.\n4. Start ImageJ, and open an image file.\n5. Select the `Plugins > Measure Holes` menu item to run the plugin. This will create a binary version of the image, measure the particles in the image, and display the results in a window.\n\nYou can also modify the code to change the measurements that are computed, or to customize the behavior of the plugin in other ways. For example, you can add additional code to display the results in a custom dialog, or to save the results to a file.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

The JDK includes the `javac` compiler, which you can use to compile Java code into bytecode that can be run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nOnce you have the JDK installed, you can compile the code by opening a command prompt or terminal, navigating to the directory where you saved the `Measure_Holes.java` file, and running the `javac` command with the file name as an argument. For example:\n```\njavac Measure_Holes.java\n```\nThis will compile the code and create a `Measure_Holes.class` file in the same directory. The `.class` file contains the bytecode for the plugin, which can be run on the JVM.\n\nIf you encounter any errors during the compilation process, you can use the `-verbose` flag to get more detailed information about the errors. For example:\n```\njavac -verbose Measure_Holes.java\n```\nThis will print detailed information about any compilation errors to the terminal, which can help you troubleshoot the problem.\n\nI hope this helps!

        "value": "I want to give you some information to use in more questions to follow. here is the information. I have a Saas Company Called Fitclass.com. It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT."
